However, it will be \nrecalled that in October 2024, NUPRC launched Project 1 million Barrels which \nis expected to favourably impact the national production. NUPRC is leveraging \nthe capacity of upstream operators to meet the target daily production of Two \nMillion, Five Hundred Thousand Barrels (2,500,000 Bopd) in the short term. \n \nThis strategic initiative aligns with Nigeria's commitment to bolstering its \ndomestic refining capacity and ensuring the sustainability of its oil industry. The \nfirst half of 2025 is expected to witness increased synergy between local \nrefineries and producing companies, setting the stage for a more robust and \nself-reliant petroleum landscape in Nigeria. \n \n \nEngr.

Five (5) of the \nregulations have been completed and gazetted while \nthirteen (13) other draft regulations have been \nreviewed with stakeholders and awaiting gazetting. \nINITIATIVES TO ENHANCE GAS PRODUCTION \n22. In line with the Federal Government’s declaration of \nthe period 2021 - 2030 as the Decade of Gas, the \nCommission is taking steps to expand and develop the \nNation’s huge gas resources through enhanced gas \nexploration, development and utilization schemes. This \nwill ultimately lead to gas reserves’ growth, increased \ngas production, maturation of domestic and export gas \nmarket, as well as gas flare elimination."}

What is the Domestic Crude Supply Obligation (DCSO)? The Domestic\nCrude Supply Obligation (DCSO} is a regulatory requirement mandating oil-\nproducing companies in Nigeria to allocate a portion of their crude oil\nproduction for domestic refining. This ensures sufficient feedstock for local\nrefineries and enhances national energy security, in line with Section 109 of the\nPetroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021.\n\n2. | Why was the DCSO introduced in Nigeria? The DCSO was introduced to:\n° Ensure a steady supply of crude oil to domestic refineries.\n° Reduce Nigeria's dependence on imported refined petroleum products.\n\n° Promote local refining capacity and support the growth of the\ndownstream sector.\n\no Enhance energy security and stabilize the domestic market.\n\nSs Who is responsible for enforcing the DCSO? The Nigerian Upstream\nPetroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC}) oversees the enforcement of the\nDCSO.\n\n4, How does the Commission determine the National Domestic Crude\nSupply requirement? NUPRC receives information from NMDPRA on a biannual\nbasis (by December 15 and June 15).

Denial of export permit on the volume designated for DCSO\niii. Financial penalty to applicable party.\n\n11. How do an Operator (lessees) or domestic refiner become aware of its\nobligation.\n\nAll Operators are notified of their Obligations on biannually (January 1 and July 1).\n12. Do NUPRC fix unit price of domestic crude obligation volume?\n\nNo. The upstream activities are run on a deregulated pricing basis and the PIA\nunder section 109 took cognizance of that and indicated that the pricing will\nbe on a willing buyer willing seller basis. However, to ensure reasonability and\nfairness in pricing, the Commission has directed the producer/lessee and\nrefiners to furnish the Commission of monthly offer/pricing of cargo quotes.\n\n13. Howis the pricing of domestic crude determined? The pricing of\ndomestic crude in line with section 109 of the PIA 2021is based on international\nbenchmarks, with adjustments for logistics, quality differentials, and regulatory\nframeworks. The process operates on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis.\nHowever, in cases of pricing disputes, parties must report to NUPRC for\nresolution.\n\n14. Can oil companies export crude oil after meeting their DCSO? Yes,\ncompanies can export any remaining crude oil after fulfilling their DCSO\nrequirements.\n\n15. Under what terms will NUPRC grant exemptions? If any of the terms in 9A\nholds, exemptions to export DCSO crude may be approved by NUPRC to\navoid such cargoes from becoming distressed."}

Are modular refineries eligible to receive crude under the DCSO? Yes,\nmodular refineries licensed by NMDPRA can receive crude under the DCSO,\nprovided they meet operational and regulatory requirements.\n\n17. How does the DCSO support Nigeria's energy security? By ensuring a\nsteady crude oil supply to local refineries, the DCSO helps:\n\n° Improve fuel availability\n° Reduce dependence on imports\n° Stabilize the domestic market\n\n18. Howis crude allocated to different refineries? Allocation is based on\nrefining capacity, technical efficiency, regulatory compliance, and strategic\nimportance to national supply.\n\n19, How often is the DCSO policy reviewed? The policy is reviewed\nperiodically by NUPRC to align with market conditions, refining capacities, and\nnational energy needs.\n\n20. How do newrefineries apply for crude supply under the DCSO? New\nrefineries must obtain an NMDPRA license, demonstrate technical capability,\nand apply for crude allocation through NUPRC.\n\n21. Does the DCSO apply to all oil-producing companies in Nigeria? Yes, all\noil producers must comply with the DCSO as part of their operating\nconditions.\n\n22. Howis crude supply logistics managed? Logistics are managed through\nagreements between producers, transporters, and refinery operators,\noverseen by NUPRC.\n\n23. Can crude oil meant for domestic supply be exported in case of surplus\nrefining capacity? No. Only under exceptional circumstances and with\ngovernment approval can surplus crude be exported.\n\n24. How does the Government monitor compliance? Compliance is\nmonitored through audits, reporting requirements, and on-site inspections\nconducted by NUPRC.\n\n25. Where can stakeholders get more information about the DCSO? More\ndetails can be found on the NUPRC website."}

The prevalence of “hot tapping” and \nrelated engineering contraptions today underscores \nthe growing sophistication in the illegal practice. \n4. \nIt is worthy to state that an unprecedented level \nof theft estimated at a daily average of 103,000 \nbarrels was recorded in the year 2021 and 108,000 \nbarrels in 2022.

The \nNGFCP 2022 has been restructured to reflect current industry gas flaring \nsituation, prevailing operational realities, and the inherent changes in the \nsocio-economic landscape due to the passage of time since the NGFCP \nwas designed and implemented by the Ministry of Petroleum Resources \n(MPR) and the defunct Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). \nThe Petroleum Industry Act 2021 (PIA) and its enhanced legal and \nregulatory enablers have addressed the bottlenecks that hitherto impeded \nthe expeditious implementation of the Programme. The NGFCP 2022 is \ntherefore \npoised \nto \ndeliver \nend-to-end \nvalue \nfrom \nflare \ngas \ncommercialisation to both existing and new participants. \nIn consideration of Section 105 (2) of the PIA and similar provisions enabling \nthe Commission in that respect, the Commission hereby invites existing \napplicants to validate their status and for new investors to register to \nparticipate in the NGFCP 2022 through the Programme Portal - \nwww.ngfcp.nuprc.gov.ng."}

To this end, the Federal \nGovernment pledged its commitment to Net Zero carbon emissions by 2060 \nat COP26, passed the Climate Change Act, and recently launched the \nNigeria’s Energy Transition Plan, all of which reinforce the need for the oil \nand gas industry to spearhead FGN’s mandate to reduce carbon \nemissions. \nFurthermore, the enactment of the Petroleum Industry Act, 2021 and the \nemergence of NUPRC as the upstream technical and commercial \nregulator are among significant industry reforms of the sector. Accordingly, \nthe NUPRC has streamlined the NGFCP to drive the flare auction and \naward process to successful conclusion in record time via an accelerated \ndelivery schedule. The renewed Programme will guarantee opportunities \nfor existing applicants while expanding participation to new investors. \nHarnessing natural gas destined for flaring will not only reduce carbon \nemissions but will stimulate economic growth by driving investments and \ncreating jobs. \nConsequently, NGFCP 2022 is a new expression of the Programme \nredesigned to adapt to changes in the industry and market with a renewed \nfocus to implement Government’s policy objectives for flare elimination \nand gas-based industrial economy in Nigeria. \nNGFCP 2022 is implementing the programme through a streamlined, \ntransparent, and competitive bid approach leveraging institutional"}

The success and growth witnessed in the industry over this \nperiod can be hinged on robust government policies (for example, \nNigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act and Petroleum \nIndustry Act 2021 and other regulations etc), Investment and a \ncompetent workforce. \n \nFirstly, before I delve into the crux of today’s topic, it is important to \nhighlight the fact that the Buhari administration achieved a huge \nmilestone in the oil and gas space via the passage of the PIA in 2021. We \nall agree that the passage of the PIA brought about clarity and investors’ \nconfidence to oil and gas business in Nigeria, considering the fact that"}

Furthermore, it \nis remarkable that the PIA via Chapter 5, Section 314 guaranteed that \nno staff of the defunct DPR, PEF and PPPRA would lose his or her job as a \nresult of the transition to the Commission and Authority. This policy as \nenshrined in the PIA resulted in the first major interagency reform that \nresulted in a 100% job retainment of all staff by the government. \nEvidently, the PIA aims to facilitate more jobs within the oil and gas sector \nvia new policy thrusts that shall drive investment and create value for \ntwo hundred million Nigerians. \n \nInterestingly, the topic for this address is germane, as fossil fuel-based \ncompanies have been targeted as the main culprit causing \nenvironmental pollution and stalling the move towards clean energy or \nzero carbon emission. However, you will agree with me that in recent \ntimes, the clamour for clean energy has altered the world’s energy \nlandscape and caused huge investment deprioritisation towards fossil \nfuels as the dominant fuel of choice. Historically, it is important to note \nthat the policy drivers of previous energy transitions were developed \nafter the technology had proved to be both efficient and economical; \nthese factors caused a natural transition towards the new energy \ntechnology based on the fulfilment of simple techno-economic \nprinciples. However, the current energy transition which has been \nlargely driven first by- Policies- suffered various setbacks because of \ntechno-economic flaws ( such as storage concerns due to intermittency \nof solar and wind energy and price of energy from clean sources) which \ndoes not support a natural transition towards the new energy technology \nby the larger part of the world at this time. This concern coupled with \nother critical social externalities such as world geopolitics, energy \nsecurity and energy access have the potential to stall the justification for"}

Evidently, it is based on this premise that the \nFederal Government declared Gas as our transition fuel towards a low-\ncarbon future, which further re-enforced the fact that Nigeria is more of \na gas rich than an oil rich nation. \n \nHaving made this point clear, it is important to re-iterate that the speed \nof the energy transition is uncertain, its ultimate aim is towards a low-\ncarbon future. As you know, during COP 26 more than 150 countries \nhave put forward new or updated emissions targets, with several African \ncountries including Nigeria, making various commitments to restrict \nmethane emissions, halt, and reverse forest loss, phase out coal, and end \ninternational financing for fossil fuels. Nigeria committed to net zero by \n2060. Undoubtedly, these commitments pose a challenge to the oil \nindustry, but there-in lies huge opportunities that can be leveraged upon \nto position ourselves strongly in the new energy landscape. The picture is \nnot a totally gloomy situation as projections show that over the next two \ndecades, rapid population growth and industrialization are expected to \ndrive strong energy demand growth across Nigeria and Africa—\nincluding for fossil fuels, which will result in an increase in job \nopportunities.

To this end, the Africa Export Import bank (Afrexim) and \nAfrica Petroleum Producers Organisation (APPO) have decided to set up an \nAfrica Energy Bank to provide capital for oil and gas projects in Africa. \nAnother critical enabler that can affect the Nigerian workforce during this \ntime of energy transition phase is Just Transition. The “just transition” \nphilosophy ensures environmental sustainability as well as decent work, \nsocial inclusion, and poverty eradication. Given that Nigeria has a high \npoverty rate, the importance of foregrounding just transition principles \ncannot be overemphasized. The Host Communities Development Trust \n(HCDT) and the Local Content Act have the potential to guarantee \nlongevity of the oil and gas industry during these changing times. To stay \ncompetitive and relevant the Nigerian worker will have to upskill in this \nregard. \nAs Nigeria and other African economies look to industrialize to meet the \nneeds of rapidly growing and urbanizing populations, a rise in energy \ndemand could leave many countries facing energy supply challenges. \nHidden in the challenges that have been highlighted through the course of \nthis address, are significant opportunities.

This Template is one of the measures to promote \nenergy sustainability and environmental stewardship in Nigeria’s upstream \noperations in alignment with Nigeria’s commitment to net zero emissions and \nthe imperatives for global energy transition. By this, the Commission is \ndeepening its efforts to align the upstream petroleum industry with national \npriorities and international climate goals while ensuring sustainable value \ncreation from oil & gas resources for Nigeria’s energy security and economic \ndevelopment. \nRecall that in 2023, the NUPRC introduced the “Regulatory Framework for \nEnergy Transition, Decarbonisation, and Carbon Monetisation in the Nigerian \nUpstream Oil and Gas Sector,” to signal the direction to the industry to enable \nsustained (and improved) competitiveness in global energy markets.

By implementing \nthese, the Commission ensures compliance with Nigeria’s broader climate \nobjectives, including its commitment to Net Zero by 2060. \nAgainst the foregoing, this Template will become a mandatory component \nof applications for licences, permits, and approvals across upstream activities, \ncommencing in January 2025. The UPDT mandates the integration of \ndecarbonisation strategies/plans into upstream operations including Field \nDevelopment Plans (FDPs), wells, drilling & rig operations, and project/facility \nengineering. Operators would therefore establish measurable and time-\nbound greenhouse gas reduction goals aligned with national targets. \nCompanies are also required to demonstrate compliance with the Gas \nFlaring, Venting, and Methane Emissions Regulations, 2023, and related \nGuidelines, to eliminate routine flaring and venting in their operations. \nAdditionally, operators must implement methane management programmes \nsuch as leak detection and repair, optimise operations using energy-efficient \ntechnologies, and integrate renewable energy sources into their projects and \noperations. The UPDT also stipulates the development of carbon \nmanagement and monetisation initiatives, including Carbon Capture and \nStorage (CCS), nature-based solutions, carbon offset projects, etc."}
