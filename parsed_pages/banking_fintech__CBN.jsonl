In determining whether a particular set of activities\nand assets is a business, the Group assesses whether the set of assets and activities\nacquired includes, at a minimum, an input and substantive process and whether the acquired\nset has the ability to produce outputs.\n\nThe Group has an option to apply a ‘concentration test’ that permits a simplified assessment\nof whether an acquired set of activities and assets is not a business. The optional\nconcentration test is met if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is\nconcentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets.\n\nThe consideration transferred in the acquisition is generally measured at fair value, as are the\n\nidentifiable net assets acquired. Any goodwill that arises is tested annually for impairment.\nAny gain on bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately.\n\n21"}

The Group ‘controls’ an entity if it is\nexposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the\nability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The Group reassesses whether\nit has control if there are changes to one or more of the elements of contro!. This includes\ncircumstances in which protective rights held (e.g those resulting from a lending relationship)\nbecome substantive and lead to the Group having power over an investee.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the summary consolidated financial\nstatements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control\nceases.\n\nAssets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the\nyear are included in the summary consolidated financial statements from the date the Group\ngains control until the date the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.\n\nProfit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income (OCI) are attributed to the\nequity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this\nresults in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.

Significant influence\nis the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is\nnot control or joint controt over those policies.\n\nThe considerations made in determining significant influence or joint control are similar to\nthose necessary to determine control over subsidiaries.\n\nThe Group's investments in its associates are accounted for using the equity method. Under\nthe equity method, the investment in an associate is initially recognised at cost which includes\ntransaction costs. The carrying amount of the investment is adjusted to recognise changes in\nthe Group’s share of net assets of the associate since the acquisition date. Goodwill relating\nto the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised\nnor individually tested for impairment.\n\nDividend received or receivable from associates are recognised as a reduction in the carrying\nvalue of the Group investment carrying value.\n\nThe income statement reflects the Group's share of the results of operations of the associate.\nAny change in OCI of those investees is presented as part of the Group’s OCI. In addition,\nwhen there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group\nrecognises its share of any changes, when applicable, in the statement of changes in equity\nUnrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate\nare eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.\n\n2.1.4 Recognition of income and expenses\n(a) The effective interest rate method\n\nUnder IFRS 9, interest income is recorded using the effective interest rate (EIR) method for\nall debt instruments measured at amortised cost and interest bearing financial assets\nmeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOC1) under IFRS 9.\n\nInterest bearing financial assets measured at FVOCI under IFRS 9 are also recorded by\nusing the EIR method. The EIR is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash\nreceipts through the expected life of the financial asset or, when appropriate, a shorter period,\nto the net carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nThe EIR (and therefore, the amortised cost of the asset) is calculated by taking into account\nany discount or premium on acquisition, fees and costs that are an integral part of the EIR for\nall financial instruments other than those measured at FVTPL. The Group recognises interest\nincome using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of retum\nover the expected life of the financial instruments. Hence, it recognises the effect of\npotentially different interest rates charged at various stages, and other characteristics of the\nproduct life cycle (including prepayments, penalty interest and charges).\n\nIf expectations regarding the cash flows on the financial asset are revised due to credit risk,\nthe adjustment is booked as a positive or negative adjustment to the carrying amount of the\nasset in the statement of financial position with an increase or reduction in interest income.\nThe adjustment is subsequently amortised through interest income in the income statement.\n\n23"}

The\nGroup calculates interest income on financial assets, other than those considered credit-\nimpaired, by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset.\n\nWhen a financial asset becomes credit-impaired and is therefore regarded as ‘Stage 3’, the\nGroup calculates interest income by applying the EIR to the net amortised cost of the financial\nasset. If the financial assets cures and is no longer credit-impaired, the Group reverts to\ncalculating interest income on a gross basis and recognise reversal from the improvement in\nthe profit or loss.\n\n(c) Foreign exchange revaluation gains or losses\nThese are gains and losses arising on settlement and translation of monetary assets and\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the functional currency's spot rate of exchange\nat the reporting date. This amount is recognised in the income statement and it is further\nbroken down into realised and unrealised portion.\nThe monetary assets and liabilities inctude financial assets within the external reserves,\nforeign currencies deposits received and held on behalf of third parties, etc.\n\n(d) Other operating expenses\nAll other operating expenses are recognised at cost when incurred.\n2.1.5 Income taxes\nCurrent income tax\n\nCurrent tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss\nfor the year, and any adjustment to tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years.\n\nThe Bank is not subject to tax in respect of its functions under the Central Bank of Nigeria Act\n2007. The Bank is exempted from the payment of tax under the Companies Income Tax Act,\nCap C21, LFN 2004 (as amended).\n\nDeferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax\nbases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at\nthe reporting date.\n\n24"}

A cash shortfall is the\ndifference between the cash flows that are due to an entity in accordance with the contract\n\nand the cash flows that the entity expects to receive.\n\nThe mechanics of the ECL calculations are outlined below and the key elements are, as\n\nfollows:\n\n* PD: The Probability of Default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time\nhorizon. A default may only happen at a certain time over the assessed period, if the facility\n\nhas not been previously derecognised and is still in the portfolio.\n\n* EAD: The Exposure at Default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking\ninto account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments\nof principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, and accrued interest\n\nfrom missed payments.\n\n* LGD: The Loss Given Default is an estimate of the loss arising in the case where a default\noccurs at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due\nand those that the lender would expect to receive. It is usually expressed as a percentage of\n\nthe EAD.\n\nWhen estimating the ECLs, the Group considers three scenarios (a base case, an upturn and\ndownturn). When relevant, the assessment of multiple scenarios also incorporates how\ndefaulted loans or financial investment are expected to be recovered, including the probability\nthat the loans or financial investment will cure and the amount that might be received from\n\nselling the asset.\n\nThe maximum period for which the credit losses are determined is the contractual life of a\n\nfinancial instrument unless the Bank has the legal right to call it earlier.\nThe mechanics of the ECL method are summarized below:\n\n* Stage 1: The 12months ECL is calculated as the portion of LTECLs that represent the ECLs\nthat result from default events on a financial instrument that are possible within the 12 months\n\nafter the reporting date.\n\n* Stage 2: When a loan has shown a significant increase in credit risk since origination, the\n\nGroup records an allowance for the Lifetime ECLs.\n\n* Stage 3: For loans considered credit-impaired, the Group recognises the lifetime expected\ncredit losses for these financial instruments. The method is similar to that for Stage 2 assets,\n\nwith the PD set at 100%.\n\nLoan commitments: When estimating LTECLs for undrawn toan commitments, the Group\nestimates the expected portion of the loan commitment that will be drawn down over its\nexpected life. The ECL is then based on the present value of the expected shortfalls in cash\nflows if the loan is drawn down, based on a probability-weighting of the four scenarios. The\nexpected cash shortfalls are discounted at an approximation to the expected EIR on the loan.\n\nThe ECL for loan commitments is recognised within other liabilities.\n\n30"}

Previously, the Group's\n38.3% interest in AFC was accounted for an associate but reclassified in 2024 from an investment in\nassociate to financial asset at fair value through profit or loss. This policy has been applied\n\nprospectively.\n2.1.32.2 Estimates and assumptions\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date,\nthat have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and\nliabilities within the next financial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and\nestimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared. Existing\ncircumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market\nchanges or circumstances beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the\n\nassumptions when they occur.\nFair value measurement of financial instruments\n\nWhen the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the statement of financial\nposition cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured\nusing valuation techniques such as the discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The inputs to these\nmodels are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of\njudgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as\nliquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the\nreported fair value of financial instruments. The financial instruments that fall under this category are\n\nequity instrument with significant unobservable inputs.\nimpairment losses on financial assets\n\nimpairment tosses on financial assets - FRCN Guideline\n\nFinanciat assets that have low credit risk shall be assessed for 12-months expected credit loss and\nfor such financial assets, the practical expedient approach under the ECL model have been\nconsidered. Based on the unique nature of the Bank's role, there is a rebuttable presumption that ECL\non sovereign loans, receivables from Federal Government and its agencies and sovereign securities\n\nheld by CBN is zero.\n\n39"}

These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes in which can result in different\n\nlevels of allowances.\n\nThe Group’s ECL calculations are outputs of complex models with a number of underlying\nassumptions regarding the choice of variable inputs and their interdependencies. Elements of the\n\nECL models that are considered accounting judgements and estimates include:\n\n* The Bank's criteria for assessing if there has been a significant increase in credit risk and so\nallowances for financial assets should be measured on a LTECL basis and the qualitative\n\nassessment\n\n* The segmentation of financial assets when their ECL is assessed on a collective basis\n* Development of ECL models, including the various formulas and the choice of inputs\nFinancial assets other than trade receivables and sovereign securities\n\n* Determination of associations between macroeconomic scenarios and, economic inputs, such as\nsprime lending rate unemployment rate, inflation rate and crude oit prices, and the effect on PDs,\n\nEADs and LGDs\n\n+ Selection of forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios and their probability weightings, to derive the\n\neconomic inputs into the ECL models\n\nIt has been the Group's policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience\n\nand adjust when necessary.\n\nProvision for expected credit losses of trade receivables\n\nThe Group uses a provision matrix to calculate ECLs for trade receivables. The provision rates are\nbased on days past due for groupings of various customer segments that have similar loss patterns\n(i.e., by geography, product type, customer type and rating, and coverage by letters of credit and other\n\nforms of credit insurance).\n\nThe provision matrix is initially based on the Group's historical observed default rates. The Group will\ncalibrate the matrix to adjust the historical credit loss experience with forward-looking information.\n\nDefined benefit plans\n\nThe cost of the defined benefit pension plan, long service awards, gratuity scheme and post-\nemployment medical benefits and the present value of these defined benefit obligations are\ndetermined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions\nthat may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the\ndiscount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the\ncomplexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly\nsensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\nDepreciation and carrying value of property and equipment\n\nThe estimation of the useful lives of assets is based on management's judgement. Any material\nadjustment to the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment will have an impact on the\n\ncarrying value of these items."}

The land and buildings were valued by reference to transactions involving\nproperties of a similar nature, location and condition. The Group revalued its land and buitding in the\ncurrent year because valuations are performed every 2 - 3 years with sufficient frequency to ensure\nthat the carrying amount of the revatued property does not differ materially from its fair value (the\nGroup engaged an independent valuation specialist to assess fair values as at 31 December 2024).\n\nRecognition and measurement of contingencies (litigations): Key assumptions about the\nitkelihood and magnitude of an outflow of resources\n\nThe Group is involved in various litigations and arbitration both in Nigeria and in other jurisdictions,\narising in the ordinary course of operations.\n\nWhen the Group can reliably measure the outflow of economic benefits in relation to a specific case\nand considers such outflows to be probable, the Group records a provision against the case. Where\nthe probability of outflow is considered to be remote, or probable, but a reliable estimate cannot be\nmade, a contingent liability is disclosed. However, when the Group is of the opinion that disclosing\nthese estimates on a case-by-case basis would prejudice their outcome, then the Group does not\ninclude detailed, case-specific disclosers in its financial statements.\n\nGiven the subjectivity and uncertainty of determining the probability and amount of losses, the Group\n\ntakes into account a number of factors including legal advice, the stage of the matter and historical\nevidence from similar incidents. Significant judgement is required to conclude on these estimates.\n\n41"}

With the \neffusion of time, these balances continue to accumulate in banks and \nOFIs in the Financial System. The owners of the funds, however, may \nnot receive adequate compensation for their funds. Also, dormant \naccounts and unclaimed balances are susceptibility to fraudulent \ntransactions or abuse. These are some of the issues the Guidelines \nseeks to remedy. \n \n3. \nWhat are the objectives of the Guidelines? \nThe Guidelines seeks to: \ni. \nidentify dormant accounts/unclaimed balances and financial \nassets; \nii. \nhold the funds in trust for the beneficial owners; \niii. \nstandardize the management of dormant accounts/unclaimed \nbalances and financial assets; \niv. \nestablish a standard procedure for reclaiming warehoused funds; \nand"}

Dormant accounts are accounts that have \nbeen inactive for one (1) year or more, while domiciliary are accounts \nthat hold currencies other than the Naira. \n \nThe Guidelines does not require banks to transfer funds in domiciliary \naccounts to the CBN.

To increase public \nconfidence in the financial system, it is imperative that institutions operate in a safe and secure \nenvironment. \nFinancial Institutions leverage information technology to expedite the flow of funds among entities \nand for the provision of services to their customers. The technology infrastructure and platforms \nthat support their operations should be managed to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity and \navailability of information assets, as well as prevent financial loss and mitigate reputational risk. \nCybersecurity threats have continued to evolve and become more complex, with increased \nfrequency of threats such as phishing, ransomware, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) \nattacks, amongst others. Consequently, financial institutions are required to proactively secure \ntheir critical information assets to ensure that they remain resilient in the face of these persistent \nthreats. The prevalence of the use of emerging technology by financial institutions to deliver \nservices to customers has also increased their attack surface. \nIt is in this regard that the CBN Risk-Based Cybersecurity Framework and Guidelines for Deposit \nMoney Banks (DMBs) and Payment Service Banks (PSBs) is issued. The framework, which \noutlines the minimum cybersecurity controls to be put in place, is designed to provide guidance \nin the implementation of cybersecurity programmes towards enhancing resilience in the financial \nsector. \nThe framework, which provides a risk-based approach to managing cybersecurity risk, comprises \nseven parts: Cybersecurity Governance and Oversight; Cybersecurity Risk Management System; \nEnhancing Cybersecurity Resilience; Emerging Technologies; Metrics, Monitoring and Reporting; \nCompliance with Statutory and Regulatory Requirements; and Enforcement. \nThis framework replaces the Risk-based Cybersecurity Framework and Guidelines for Deposit \nMoney Banks and Payment Service Providers issued in October 2018 to address emerging gaps \nin the cybersecurity landscape. It equally considers requirements of recent laws and regulations \nsuch as the Banks and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA 2020) and Nigerian Data \nProtection Act (NDPA) 2023. The framework should be read in conjunction with the provisions of \nall directives, notices, circulars and guidelines that the CBN may issue from time to time. \nThe CBN Risk-based Cybersecurity Framework and Guidelines for DMBs and PSBs, 2024, shall \napply to the following financial institutions under the purview of Banking Supervision Department \n– Commercial banks, Merchant banks, Non-Interest banks and Payment Service banks, which \nare hereinafter jointly referred to as Supervised Financial Institutions (SFIs)."}

Let me start by acknowledging a reality we all recognize. While these\nreforms have delivered progress, many Nigerians still grapple with rising\ncosts and limited opportunities. From traders in Aba to farmers in Taraba,\npeople across the country are striving to build better futures despite\nsignificant challenges. | want to assure you that at the Central Bank, every\ndecision we make is driven by a commitment to serving the best interests of\nthe people. This is why we will continue strengthening our internal capacity\nand processes to ensure our decisions remain firmly rooted in evidence-\n\nbased analysis."}

As you are aware, the world economy has\nweathered significant storms over the past two years following the COVID-\n19 pandemic: the impact of the Russia-Ukraine war on energy and food\nprices, the surge in global inflation and the subsequent tightening of\nmonetary policy in advanced markets. These factors have led to a\nwithdrawal of capital flows from emerging markets, creating new challenges\nfor economies like ours.\n\nIn 2024, we have seen signs of improvement. Global inflation is projected to\ndecline to 3.5 percent in 2025, down from its peak of 9.4 percent in 2022.\nMajor central banks are gradually easing their monetary conditions and this\nshift is slowly reopening access to international capital markets for emerging\neconomies. However, global growth remains subdued at 2.6 percent,\nhindered by geopolitical tensions, China's economic slowdown, and growing\ntrade fragmentation.\n\nSub-Saharan Africa has seen modest growth of 3.6% this year, while still\nlagging pre-pandemic levels. The effects of monetary tightening measures\nhave helped to curb inflation in some key markets such as South Africa and\nKenya but many countries are still grappling with double-digit inflation rates\nand high debt service burdens. These challenges constrain the resources\navailable for critical investment in education, healthcare and infrastructure.\nEven though we see countries gradually returning to the Eurobond market\ndue to a reduction in interest rates in advanced markets, progress is uneven\ngiven the significant disparity in growth and inflation faced by resource-\nintensive countries like Nigeria and Angola.\n\nDomestic Conditions\n\n9.\n\n10.\n\nIn light of these global challenges, it is imperative to sustain and enhance\nreforms aimed at strengthening our economic buffers to withstand external\nshocks. This requires a steadfast focus on curbing inflation, ensuring fiscal\ndiscipline, and advancing initiatives that promote greater economic\ndiversification.\n\nUpon assuming office in October 2023, we prioritized reforms to rebuild\nNigeria’s economic buffers and strengthen resilience. Inflation, which had\nsurged to 27%, was one of the most pressing challenges, partly driven by\nexcessive money supply growth. While our GDP growth had stagnated at a"}

This imbalance not only\nfueled inflation but also contributed to a significant depreciation of the\nnaira. As we all know, inflation creates uncertainty for households and\nbusinesses, acting as a silent tax by eroding purchasing power and driving\nup living costs.\n\nThe nation was also grappling with a fiscal crisis, marked by unsustainable\ndeficit financing through the Central Bank's Ways and Means advances,\nwhich had reached an unprecedented N22.7 trillion by 2023—equivalent to\nalmost 11% of our GDP. In addition, quasi-fiscal interventions by the CBN,\ntotaling over N10 trillion, undermined market confidence and weakened the\neffectiveness of our policy tools.\n\nThese actions shifted focus away from our primary responsibility—\nmaintaining price stability. They compromised transparency by bypassing\nessential oversight mechanisms, which are vital for accountability. Moreover,\nthey strained monetary stability, contributing to inflationary pressures and\nmarket distortions. Under my leadership, we have taken decisive steps to\nmove away from these practices. We have ended years of fiscal deficits\nfinanced through CBN’s Ways and Means advances, reinforcing our\ncommitment to price stability and promoting fiscal discipline.\n\nTo tackle the pressing challenge of inflation, the CBN acted decisively by\nraising the Monetary Policy Rate by 875 basis points to 27.5% in 2024—an\nessential move to contain inflation and restore stability.\n\nTo borrow from Winston Churchill’s famous perspective: in our world,\ninterest rates are undoubtedly the least desirable tool for combating\ninflation—except for all the others! | fully recognize the challenges that\nhigher interest rates impose on businesses and families. However, these\nmeasures are not intended to be permanent. We are closely monitoring the\ndata, and as inflation shows sustained signs of improvement—something we\nexpect in the near future—we will adjust rates accordingly.\n\nOur tight monetary policy stance has altered the previous dire trajectory,\nand we expect a downward trend in 2025. Inflation remains unacceptably\nhigh, but the signs are encouraging, particularly given that the full effects of\nmonetary policy typically take 6-9 months to impact the consumer sector.\nOur commitment is unwavering: we will prioritize price stability until its\nbenefits are felt by every Nigerian."}

This\nregime stifled much needed foreign investment, and led to the depletion of\nour external reserves which fell to $33.22bn in December 2023. It must also\nbe understood that the cost of the FX subsidy regime is estimated to far\nexceed that of fuel subsidies. In 2022 alone, the potential revenue lost due\nto a less flexible FX regime was approximately N6.2 trillion, compared to\nN4.5 trillion from fuel subsidies. These funds could have significantly\ncontributed to critical investments in education, healthcare, and\ninfrastructure development.\n\nForeign Exchange Market\n\n17.\n\n18.\n\n19.\n\nOver the past year, we have undertaken critical reforms to unify Nigeria’s\nexchange rate, eliminating distortions and restoring transparency. This\nunification has enabled us to clear the outstanding foreign exchange\nobligations, giving businesses—ranging from manufacturers to airlines—the\nconfidence to plan and invest in the future. To further enhance the\nfunctionality of the foreign exchange market, we are introducing an\nelectronic FX matching system, which has proven effective in other\nmarkets.\n\nIt is vital to address the disinformation circulating about a supposed\ndemand-supply gap in the FX market, which is fueling unnecessary panic.\nThe current USD exchange rate reflects the price that the most desperate\nbuyers are willing to pay, and this does not represent the true market value\nof the naira. The introduction of the electronic matching system will correct\nthese distortions by enhancing the price discovery process. Additionally, it\nwill significantly boost the Central Bank's oversight and intervention\ncapabilities, ensuring a more stable and transparent foreign exchange\nmarket.\n\nWhile the Central Bank will continue to lay the foundation for price stability\nand foster a conducive policy environment, the role of our banks in this\njourney is crucial. An FX market defined solely by when and how the Central\nBank buys or sells dollars is inadequate for the needs of a dynamic economy\nlike Nigeria's.

Re-education is critical—concepts\nlike \"willing buyer/willing seller\" have been misinterpreted, and the market\nhas forgotten that at least one counterparty in a transaction must be an\nauthorized dealer. We must restore these standards and uphold industry\nethics. We will also prioritize capacity development and continuous\neducation at the CBN, which is home to many talented individuals.\n\nThe ethics and professionalism of bankers and treasurers are under constant\nscrutiny, which is why we have introduced the FX Global Code for all\nauthorized dealers and market participants. | urge this institute to take the\nlead in upholding and demonstrating the highest standards in the industry.\nAt the Central Bank, we have intensified surveillance of market activities to\nensure compliance and eliminate bad actors who attempt to undermine the\nsystem.

In recognition of the high level of digitalization within\nthe financial system and rapid emergence of innovative products, the CBN has\ndeveloped a draft document titled \"Baseline Standards for Automated Anti-Money\nLaundering (AML) Solutions\". The Standard is aimed at promoting operational\nefficiency and regulatory compliance to AML/CFT/CPF requirements by financial\ninstitutions in Nigeria. This standard is informed by a comprehensive assessment of\nexisting solutions within the industry. It aligns with global best practices and\ninternational regulatory frameworks, including the recommendations of the Financial\nAction Task Force (FATF).\n\nThe objectives of these standards include:\n\ne Strengthening the AML/CFT/CPF capabilities of financial institutions through\ntechnology-driven approaches:\n\ne Encouraging the adoption of emerging technologies to enhance the detection\nand reporting of suspicious transactions in real time;\n\ne Reducing operational inefficiencies associated with manual AML processes;\n\ne Supporting compliance with evolving domestic and international regulatory\nexpectations. ‘\n\nThe CBN hereby exposes the draft Baseline Standards for Automated AML\nSolutions to all stakeholders and invites comments and suggestions to enrich the final\nversion. 4"}

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a critical priority for\nfinancial systems worldwide. In Nigeria, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) plays a\npivotal role in ensuring the stability and integrity of the financial system. As financial\ntransactions become increasingly digitized, the need for robust, automated AML\nsolutions has never been more urgent. These solutions leverage advanced\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence (Al), machine learning (ML), and big data\nanalytics to detect, prevent, and report suspicious activities in real-time.\n\nThe Baseline Standards for Automated AML Solutions is hereby issued to ensure\nuniformity, efficiency, and compliance across financial institutions in Nigeria. These\nstandards are based on findings from an assessment of AML solutions in the industry.\nThe standards also incorporate global best practices and align with international\nregulatory frameworks, such as the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)\nrecommendations.\n\nThe adoption of these standards will enable financial institutions to enhance their\nAMLICFT/CPF capabilities, reduce operational inefficiencies, and comply with\nevolving regulatory requirements. By implementing these standards, the Nigerian\nfinancial sector will be better equipped to combat money laundering and terrorist\nfinancing, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the financial system.\n\n2. OBJECTIVES\nThe primary objectives of these baseline standards are to:\n\n1. Ensure Effective Implementation of Automated AML Solutions: Provide a\nframework for the deployment and operation of automated AML solutions that\nmeet regulatory requirements and industry best practices.\n\n2. Promote Interoperability and Integration: Facilitate seamless integration of\nAML systems with other financial systems to ensure efficient data sharing and\ncompliance reporting."}

However, the current \ndilapidation of the facility has rendered it ineffective to serve its original objective of being a \nglobal centre for specialized training. \n \n3.0 \nConsequently, the Bank now wishes to invite reputable and competent Contractors and \nConsultants with certified knowledge, verifiable capacity and experience to indicate interest to \nprequalify for the Proposed Renovation of the Central Bank of Nigeria, International Training \nInstitute Maitama, Abuja. \n \n4.0 \nSCOPE OF WORK \nThe scope of works comprises but not limited to the following: \n \na. Total Renovation of the CBN ITI Maitama, Abuja \nb. Provision of Consultancy services as follows: \n \n• Project Management \n• Architectural \n• Structural Engineering \n• Quantity Surveyors \n• Electrical Engineering \n• Mechanical Engineering \n \n \n5.0 \nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS: \nInterested and competent contractors must submit the following documents for verification: \n \nMandatory Requirements: \n \na) \nEvidence of Certificate of Incorporation and Registration with the Corporate Affairs \nCommission (CAC) including Form CAC2 and CAC7; \nb) \nCertified true copy of Memorandum and Article of Association;"}

What is a foreign exchange forward contract? \nA foreign exchange (FX) forward contract is an agreement between two parties to exchange a \nspecified amount of one currency for another at a predetermined exchange rate on a future date. \n2. What type of foreign exchange contract did counterparties enter into with the CBN? \nCounterparties entered into a bespoke foreign exchange contract, wherein Naira was taken upfront in \nexchange for future delivery of US Dollars by the Central Bank of Nigeria. \n3. Under what circumstances can a foreign exchange forward contract be nullified/cancelled? \nA foreign exchange forward contract may be nullified or cancelled under the following conditions: \na) Fraud or Misrepresentation. \nb) Lack of proper documentation. \nc) Illegality or breach of law. \nd) Regulatory non-compliance or violation of applicable CBN circulars or FX guidelines, which \nrender the contract void or unenforceable. \n4. Why did the CBN subject the undelivered forwards to a forensic audit? \nThe CBN undertook a forensic audit to ensure the integrity of the foreign exchange market and to \nconfirm that all outstanding forward contracts were legitimate, valid, and met the agreed contractual \nand regulatory requirements. This step was necessary to safeguard Nigeria’s FX reserves, promote \nmarket discipline, and ensure fairness to all participants. This step reflects the CBN’s statutory \nresponsibility to ensure prudence, legality, and fairness in the management of public financial \nresources, especially where previous actions may have breached that standard. \n5. Who audited the outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts? \nIn September 2023, CBN engaged Deloitte to conduct a comprehensive forensic audit of all transactions \nin the Retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (RSMIS), including undelivered forward contracts."}

What did the forensic audit involve? \nThe audit involved: \n• \nReviewing contract documentation and trade confirmations. \n• \nVerifying underlying trade transactions (e.g., import/export documentation, Form M, shipping \nand Customs records). \n• \nConfirming that contracts complied with applicable CBN circulars and FX market guidelines. \n• \nEnsuring that beneficiaries were genuine and eligible counterparties. \n7. What were the findings of the forensic audit? \nThe forensic audit uncovered significant irregularities in the execution of some of the foreign exchange \nforward contracts. Each finding was based on objective and verifiable data, and all affected \ncounterparties were given an opportunity to respond before final decisions invalidating these contracts \nwere made. \n8. Why, specifically, were some contracts invalidated? \nSome undelivered forward contracts were found to be invalid for various infractions and reasons, \nincluding: \na) Company Name on Approved Sales Result Different from Company Name on Form M Portal. \nb) The cumulative value of the approved FX Forward Sales on this Forex Form Number from \nAuction 1 in 2021 to date of this auction exceeds the total value of the Forex Form Number. \nc) Sales Higher Than Demand. \nd) Non-permissible Item of Import. \ne) Unauthorized Companies Importing Milk. \nf) Vague Narration of the Item of Import of the Item of Import. \ng) Sales Without Demand. \nh) Incorrect Forex Form Number. \ni) Forex Form not Indicated. \nj) Blank Form M. \nk) Rejected Form A Application on Form A Portal with Approved Sales. \nl) Approved Sales Value Higher than the cost of import item on Form A portal. \nm) Approved Sales Value Higher than the cost of import item on Form M portal. \nNo right to FX settlement can arise under Nigerian law where the underlying transaction is tainted by \nillegality, misrepresentation, or non-compliance with binding regulatory rules. \n9. What happened to the valid contracts? \nAll valid and verified contracts were honoured. CBN has made payments on these contracts in line \nwith agreed settlement terms."}

What happened to the invalid contracts? \nInvalid contracts were cancelled in line with audit findings. No FX payments were made on these \ncontracts, as they did not meet the required standards for settlement, as noted in point 8 above. The \nNaira previously received from counterparties in respect of these invalid contracts has been returned. \nThe CBN is currently engaging with law enforcement authorities to determine appropriate action in \ncases involving potential fraud, misrepresentation, or abuse of the FX system. \n11. Why did CBN take this approach instead of paying all contracts? \nPaying invalid contracts would have rewarded non-compliance, encouraged abuse of the FX system, \nand unnecessarily depleted the nation’s FX reserves. The CBN’s mandate is to maintain market \nintegrity and protect Nigeria’s financial stability. Moreover, settling contracts that were legally void \nor irregular would have contravened the CBN’s statutory responsibilities and potentially exposed it to \nlegal liability and loss of public trust. \n12. Can banks or counterparties appeal the audit outcome? \nNo. The audit conclusions were based on a rigorous process carried out by an independent forensic \nexpert (Deloitte), acting pursuant to a transparent mandate. The auditor contacted the authorized \ndealer banks concerning those contracts to get their explanations of the infractions before reaching \nconclusions on them. The findings have therefore met procedural fairness standards. The case of \nundelivered forward contracts is now concluded and closed. \n13. What does this mean for future forward contracts? \nThis process reinforces CBN’s commitment to: \n• \nStrengthening due diligence in the FX market. \n• \nEnforcing compliance with documentation requirements. \n• \nEnhancing transparency and accountability in forward contract settlement. \n14. What is CBN’s message to banks and market participants? \nCBN remains committed to honouring all legitimate obligations while ensuring strict compliance with \nmarket rules. Banks and their clients are urged to maintain proper documentation, adhere to FX \nregulations, and submit only valid transactions for settlement. \n15. Is any legal action being taken against those parties deemed to have breached rules? \nThe Central Bank of Nigeria is reviewing appropriate legal action against parties found to have \nviolated applicable rules and regulations, based on the findings of the forensic audit. The Bank will \ncollaborate with law enforcement and regulatory agencies to pursue civil, administrative, or criminal \nsanctions, as necessary."}

This adjustment \naims to encourage the deployment of more ATMs while ensuring fair and transparent \ncharges for customers. \n \n▪ \nWhen will the new ATM transaction fees take effect? \nThe revised ATM transaction fees will take effect from March 1, 2025, as directed by the \nCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN). All banks and financial institutions are required to comply \nwith the CBN circular dated February 10, 2025, on “Review of Automated Teller Machine \nTransaction Fees” from this date. \n \n▪ \nWill I be charged for withdrawing money from my bank’s own ATM? \nNo, withdrawals from your bank’s own ATMs (On-Us transactions) will remain free of \ncharge. \n \n▪ \nWhat if I withdraw from an off-site ATM of my bank, will I be charged because the \nATM is off-site? \nNo, withdrawals from your bank’s own ATMs (On-Us transactions) will remain free of \ncharge. The location of the ATM does not affect customers of the bank that deployed the \nATM. \n \n▪ \nWhat are the new charges for ATM withdrawals? \nThe new charges are as follows: \n• \nOn-Us Transactions (Withdrawals at your bank’s ATM): No charge. \n• \nNot-On-Us Transactions (Withdrawals at another bank’s ATM): \no On-site ATMs: ₦100 per ₦20,000 withdrawal."}

The surcharge will be displayed on your ATM screen before \ntransaction approval. \n• \nInternational Withdrawals: Charges will be based on cost recovery, meaning the \nexact fee applied by the international acquirer will be passed to the customer. \n \n▪ \nWhat is the difference between on-site and off-site ATMs? \n• \nOn-site ATMs are located within or directly affiliated with a bank branch. In other \nwords, the ATMs are on the bank premises. \n• \nOff-site ATMs are outside a bank’s premises, such as shopping malls, fuel stations, \nor other public areas. \n \n▪ \nIt was stated that Not-On-Us Transactions (withdrawals at another bank’s ATM) \nattract a base fee of ₦100 per ₦20,000. What happens if I withdraw less than \n₦20,000 – will the ₦100 fee apply? \nYes, the fee of ₦100 will apply if you withdraw less than ₦20,000 from another bank (a \nbank other than the one that issued your payment card). The reason for applying the fee \nfor every ₦20,000 withdrawal is to prevent customers from being compelled to break their \nwithdrawals to less than ₦20,000 per withdrawal. \nIn other words, ATM transactions will incur a base fee of ₦100 per transaction. It is also \nimportant to note that a tiered fee structure will apply for transactions exceeding ₦20,000, \nwith an additional ₦100 charged for each subsequent withdrawal of N20,000 or portion \nthereof. \n \n▪ \nWill the three free monthly withdrawals for Remote-On-Us customers still apply? \nNo. The three free monthly withdrawals allowed for Remote-On-Us customers (those \nwithdrawing from another bank’s ATM) will no longer apply under the new review. \n \n▪ \nIt seems the terms “Not-on-us” and “Remote-on-us” are being used \ninterchangeably. Is this the case? \nYes, these terms are used to describe transactions at an ATM that does not belong to the \nbank that issued the payment card used. \n \n▪ \nHow will I know the surcharge amount for an off-site ATM withdrawal? \nThe surcharge (up to ₦500 per ₦20,000) will be displayed at the point of withdrawal, \nallowing customers to make an informed decision before proceeding with the transaction. \n \n▪ \nHow will this impact consumers who frequently withdraw from other banks’ ATMs?"}

Also, they may be surcharged if they withdraw \nfrom Off-site ATMs. \n \n \n \n▪ \nCan banks charge more than the stated fees? \nNo. The charges and surcharges are capped. Thus, banks and other financial institutions \nare not allowed to charge more than the fees prescribed in the circular. Note also that \nthough the surcharge per transaction is capped, there is flexibility for a bank to charge a \nlower amount depending on its cost structure and business development drive. \n \n▪ \nHow can I avoid ATM transaction fees? \nYou should withdraw money from your bank’s ATM (On-Us transaction) to avoid the \ntransaction fees. Additionally, limiting your use of Off-site ATMs is advisable to minimise \nthe surcharge. \nFurther, consumers can explore other payment channels such as mobile apps, POS \ndevices for payments, etc. \n \n▪ \nHow much will I be charged for international ATM withdrawals? \nFor withdrawals outside Nigeria, banks will apply a cost recovery fee, meaning the exact \ncharge imposed by the international ATM acquirer will be passed on to the customer. \n \n▪ \nWhat if a bank fails to allow customers to withdraw up to N20,000 per transaction? \n \nThe fees are based on banks allowing customers to withdraw up to N20,000 per \ntransaction. Any bank that compels a customer with sufficient funds in her account to \nwithdraw less than N20,000 per transaction against the customer’s desire for a higher \nsumc, would be contravening this regulation’s spirit and sanctioned appropriately. \n \n▪ \nHow will customers report contraventions of this regulation by banks? \nConsumers denied the right to withdraw up to N20,000 per transaction are encouraged \nto file a complaint with the CBN using cpd@cbn.gov.ng."}

We \nequally need to understand the impact of the support policies and programmes of \nthe Federal Government, analyse them, identify which aspects of these policies and \nprogrammes require review, and then offer a way forward. \nThe Federal Government support policies and programmes for agriculture, have \nmainly been driven through the various national development plans. Some of the \ndevelopment plans include: The medium-term plan periods (1962–1968, 1970 –1974, \n1975 –1980 and 1981–1985); the rolling plan period (1990–1998); the National \nEconomic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS) 2003–2007; and \nEconomic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP). \nNigeria’s efforts at achieving meaningful development had been hampered by \nhigh population growth rate, poverty and hunger, unemployment, illiteracy, \ndecaying and dilapidated infrastructure, as well as excessive debt burden. Others \ninclude: corruption; policy inconsistency and reversal; and lack of commitment \ntowards implementation. \n \n Alhaji Muhammad A.

Agriculture in the first 10 years after independence was \nin the exclusive list of the regional/state administration. The shortcomings coupled \nwith the arrival of the military in Nigeria politics put agricultural activities in the \nconcurrent list of the Federal and State Governments. Despite the switching roles \nand responsibilities of the Federal and State government in the constitution for its \nsharing in the 25 years between 1962 and 1985, the Federal Government gradually \nexerted its might and influence on agricultural development over the State \nGovernment and produced a number of developmental agricultural programmes \nnationwide such as: \n1. National Accelerated Production Programme (NAFPP); \n2. Operation Feed Nation (OFN); \n3. Green Revolution Programme (GRP); and \n4. Agricultural Development Project (ADP). \n \nUnder the democratic government, development policymaking entered a period \nthat gradually saw the transformation of farmers, from agrarian peasantry and \nsubsistent \nfarming \nto \ncommercial \nagriculture, \nalbeit, \nwith \nvery \nlimited \nentrepreneurship. \n \nIn the history of Nigeria, farmers’ travails have been longstanding although it had \nevolved substantially and undergone tremendous metamorphosis in terms of \nincome generation. Pre-independence, during the colonial era, and post-\nindependence where the famous pyramids were witnessed in northern Nigeria and \nother areas, we were prime producers of groundnut, cotton, cocoa, hides and skin, \noil palm fruit bunches, etc. \nDuring those periods all the above commodities were exported to European \ncountries to feed their factories, where they are processed and the value-added \nproducts returned to the various African countries, including Nigeria and marketed \nfor consumption. This system ensured perpetual employment for the European \ncitizens and gradual unemployment for the citizenries of African countries. \n \nII. \nFood Security \nAll the above policy programmes and strategic plans are aimed at improving \nfarmers productivity, income and wellbeing of the citizens through access to \naffordable quality food. The question now is, what is food security? According to the \nUnited Nations Committee on World Food Security, it ensures when all people at all \ntimes, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious \nfood that meet their food preferences and dietry needs for an active and healthy \nlife."}

So far 3.8 million farmers have benefitted under the \nprogramme. It is commendable. However, we expect high percentage recovery of \nthe loans soon, especially from cotton, rice and maize farmers. \n \nV. \nThe Effects of COVID-19 Lockdown on Implementation of theVarious \nSupport Policies and Programmes on Food Security, the Farmers \nExperience \nThe COVID-19 lockdown entailed the total prevention of people’s movement and \ninteractions from one location to another in order to prevent the spread of the virus. \nThis prevented farmers from visiting their farms and halted their engagement in any \nfarming activities during the period. \n \nThis presentation also takes into cognizance response from farmers to interviews \nconducted on issues relating to CBN development financing initiatives like NIRSAL or \nAGSMIES loans. The responses from most of the unsuccessful applicants indicated \nthat after been kept hopeful for about 2 years, they unfortunately suffered the \ndisappointment of a refusal. It appeared that their dissatisfaction was fueled by the \nimpassive and colorless tone of the rejection as follows: “dear applicant, kindly note \nthat your loan application has been declined because your request does not meet \nup with our current risk acceptance criteria, thank you.” \n \nIt is important to note that at the point making and submitting the application, the \nfarmer was never advised on those risk acceptance criteria so as to take care of \nthem. In addition, at the time of decline, which usually spans a period of between \n1–2 years of the application, the details of the risk acceptance criteria were neither \ngiven nor conveyed to respective applicants. To enhence the efficiency of loan \napplications and strengthen the effectiveness of the CBN development finance \ninitiatives, there is need to provide adequate and timely details to the applicants, \nwhile ensuring that the loan processing period is shortened. \n \nAnother important fallout of the survey is the appropriateness of beneficiaries. From \nthe response of most of the farmers interviewed, majority wondered and exclaimed \nhow the government could provide money to unskilled, untrained or non-practicing \nfarmers and expect positive impact on the economy. \nAs part of the Federal Government efforts at addressing some of the food security \nchallenges through establishment of policy thrust, the following palliative windows \nfor farmers and indeed other citizens’ wellbeing towards the Nation’s economic \nrecovery were offered.

Increase in employment generation through increased participation of \nyouth in agriculture value-chain activities; \n2. Capacity building for existing farmers and new converts as a result of \nNigeria’s border closure through the adoption and practice of new farming \ntechniques (innovations) that will increase yields and reduce post-harvest \nproduction loses; the adoption of E-extension such as Rice Advice and other \ncrops yields improvement techniques; \n3. The adoption of alternative farming methods on field and off-field (green \nhouse) or hydrophonic system with specification that has comparative \nadvantage for internal consumption or export promotion strategies; \n4. The increase in breeding techniques for animal husbandry, with merging of \nlocal and exotic breeds’ improvement techniques that ensure cost \neffectiveness in delivery, based on consumer demand or preference; \n5. A paradigm shift that ensures promotion of indigenous breeds of livestock \nfor massive production with less dependence on imported drugs or \nvaccines. For example, in poultry and other livestock, the adoption of the so \ncalled “merger” breeds – (a cross breed between local and imported \nbreeds) for massive production will ensure less mortality and increase in \npoultry meat production. It will improve economic and employment \nengagement of all strata of the Nigerian citizens – the old, the youth, male \nand female; \n6. The government introduced some Policies and programmes on Food \nsecurity as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown, etc. to alleviate the economic \nand farming set back experienced by the Farmers. However, many Farmers \ncould not benefit due largely to the logistics issues of delivery. The existing \nmodus operandi has to be reviewed and we recommend as follows; a \nsimplified means of identification of farmers, as individuals, and or through \nfarmers associations, made much easier through certification from any \nfarming skills training center under National Skill Qualification Framework \n(NSQF), and testimonial to that effect; \n7. Adaptation of new technology on crops and livestock to enhance farmers’ \nproductivity and income; \n8.

This \never-expanding financial phenomenon continues to offer numerous benefits \nto financial sector stakeholders, with positive implications for financial system \nstability in particular, and stable macroeconomic development, in general. \n \nIn Nigeria, financial digitalisation has provided the populace with a diverse \narray of financial products that were hitherto unavailable, giving millions of \nconsumers choice, speed, convenience, and ability to save time and money \nwhile carrying out their financial transactions. With the advent of digitalisation, \nthe financial industry in Nigeria has become more competitive, with over 85 \nfintech startups offering various digital financial product ranging from digital \npayments and remittances, lending, savings, and investment, to digital \ninsurance, e-commerce, and other digital financial services platforms, among \nothers (Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, 2021). \n \nIn addition to several hundred of the jobs that contribute to a reduction in \nunemployment, digital finance has attracted large amount of foreign capital \ninto the country in the form of seed capital. More importantly, the financial \nsystem has benefited immensely from digitalisation: the efficiency of the \nfinancial industry has improved due to decentralisation, diversification and \ninduced competition which forced the operators to step up their games. \nThese developments have also engendered greater transparency and \ndeeper financial inclusion. \nThese immense benefits notwithstanding, financial digitalisation poses several \nrisks and challenges to financial system stability. Some of these risks are \nfinancial, and they include contagion, excess volatility, maturity and liquidity \nmismatches, as well as procyclicality risks. Nonfinancial risks are mostly \noperational risks posed to financial stability and they include: concentration \nand business risks of critical financial market infrastructure, governance and \nregulatory control risks, data privacy, and consumer protection risks, among \nothers. \n \nRegulatory and supervisory authorities, globally and in Nigeria, are cognizant \nof these risks, and have been putting in place policies to optimise financial \ndigitalisation by maximising its benefits and reducing the potential risks.

It is thus a focal point for government authorities in promoting \neconomic objective. Financial authorities often put in place several measures \nand policies to engender financial system stability, \nincluding the \nmacroprudential policies. \n \nMacroprudential policies are sets of financial policies designed to preserve \nfinancial stability by limiting the buildup of exposures that are capable of \ncausing systemic disruptions in credit and other essential financial services that \nare supportive of stable economic growth. These policy tools assess the \nconnectedness of a financial institution with the other part of the financial \nsystem and real economy. \n \nAccording \nto \nthe \nEuropean \nCentral \nBank \n(ECB), \nmacroprudential \npolicies/tools are broadly classified into capital-based measures; liquidity-\nbased measures; borrower-based measures, instrument-based measures and \nactivity-based measures (European Central Bank, 2020; Galati & Moessner, \n2011; Lorencic & Festic, 2021; Kahou & Lehar, 2017). \n \nCapital-based measures encompass a set of capital requirements which are \ndesigned to increase the loss absorption capacity of banks, fostering financial \nsector resilience. In addition, by altering banks’ cost of capital, higher capital \nrequirements should affect the price and volume of credit. This helps tame the \nfinancial cycle by limiting credit excesses. The capital framework for banks is \nenshrined in the Basel III agreements, Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \n(2018). It comprises instruments such as, capital buffers for global systemically \nimportant \ninstitutions \nand \nother \nsystemically \nimportant \ninstitutions; \ncountercyclical capital buffers to prevent the cyclical build-up of systemic \nrisks; systemic risk buffers; and leverage restrictions, requirement to hold liquid \nassets to cope with market panics, and to make the financial system less \ncomplex (Bouchetara et al., 2020). After successfully implementing Basel II, the \nNigerian banking sector commenced the adoption of Basel III from November \n2021, based on CBN’s guidelines."}

Digitalisation of the \nfinancial system, driven largely by FinTechs presents several benefits and also \nrisks to financial stability, and hence economic growth and development. \n \nIII.1 \nBenefits of Financial Sector Digitalisation to Economic Agents \nSome of these benefits include: \n \n1) Speed and Convenience \nDigitalisation of financial services has reduced time taken for the completion \nof a financial transaction. This speed benefit is more pronounced in payment \nservices as a consumer initiating a payment transaction can expect the \npayee to receive value in matter of minutes, unlike the old days when such a \ntransaction can take days. In addition, other financial services such as credit \nand lending have also been made faster and easier with fintech. Borrowers \nmay get same-day funding from digital (fintech) lenders as the process of loan \napplication, approval and disbursement takes place online. \n2) Reduced Costs and Increased Financial Savings \nIndividual and business customers have benefited from low transaction costs \non financial services offered by FinTech and BigTech, and therefore are able \nto make savings on their financial transaction on accumulated basis. \nAccording to Acquisition International (2020), a UK fintech firm Cashplus \ndemonstrated a potential to save its customers up to 50.0 per cent of \ntransaction costs, with the total savings reaching up to GBP500 million. \n3) Improved Access to Financial Services \nThe business model of FinTech enables them to penetrate deep into remote \nareas (geographical) and market (functional) where sizable number of \npeople (potential consumers) are not served by the traditional financial \nsystem.

Much of this growth (43.0 per cent of all new accounts) originated from \nsub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where a significant proportion of the population are \nfinancially underserved. \n4) Improved Security of Transactions \nWith the awareness of potential vulnerability to threats of cyberattacks, \nFinTech and BigTech have deployed digital technology to make financial \ntransactions on their platforms more secure. FinTechs and BigTechs have used \ndata encryption to protect digitally stored data, biometric technology to \nreduce the risk of stolen passwords and falsified transaction, and data \nanalytics to identify irregular pattern and detect fraud (Organisation for \nEconomic Co-operation and Development, 2018).

Risks and vulnerabilities from excessive credit growth can be \naddressed by tools that affect all credit exposures of the banking system \n(broad-based tools). For instance, the use of countercyclical capital buffers \n(CCBs) and dynamic provisioning system which affect a wide range of \nbanking activities will no doubt increase the resilience of the financial system \nand may also moderate the pro-cyclicality of credit. \n \nWhere risks and vulnerabilities arise from unwarranted credit growth to the \nhousehold and procyclical feedback between credit and prices of asset, an \narray of sectoral tools that target a given credit class, which include sectoral \ncapital requirements (risk weights), loan-to-value, and debt-service-to-\nincome ratios, can be used to address these risks. \n \nHowever, where systemic risks and vulnerabilities arise from upsurge in \nexposures to the corporate sector, like those arising from increases in \nleverage, lending to commercial real estate or from foreign exchange \nlending to the corporate sector, specific sectoral tools, such as sectoral \ncapital requirements (risk weights) and exposure caps, would be more \nappropriate in addressing these risks. \n \nIncreases in risks and vulnerabilities due to systemic liquidity and currency risks \ncan largely be addressed by liquidity tools, such as quality liquid asset buffers, \nstable funding requirements, and limits on open positions. By limiting bank \nfunding to address systemic liquidity risk, liquidity tools can also impact credit \ngrowth. \n \nThe case of structural risks of contagion arising from interlinkages within the \nfinancial system can be managed through range of tools, including liquidity \nand capital surcharges for systemically important institutions, and measures to \ncontrol interlinkages in funding and derivatives markets. \n \nIV.2 \nCommunicating Macroprudential Policy \nIt is recommended that macroprudential policy be communicated openly by \nthe regulators/supervisors.

Digitalisation of the financial system, \ndriven largely by FinTechs poses several benefits and risks to financial stability, \nand hence economic growth and development. \n \nIV.3.1 Macroprudential Approach to Regulating FinTech \nFinTechs have been noted not to pose a significant threat to financial stability \nas their business models are constrained from assuming a scale that \ndisruptively compete with the incumbent traditional banking system \n(Rodríguez & Ortún, 2020). Notwithstanding, regulatory authorities have \nsought to manage the actual (and potential) financial stability risks of these \nfirms, using two approaches: (i) extending the existing regulation to cover \nFinTech and blocking the loopholes, (ii) use of regulatory sandboxes to \npromote stability-enhancing innovations. Regulations of FinTech, which falls \nunder these two approaches, pertain to banking-related functions (Rodríguez \n& Ortún, 2020). \n1) Regulations on Deposit-taking-like Functions \nDeposit-taking as a tightly regulated activity though remains exclusive to \nlicensed banks, the activities of FinTech with credit operation are being drawn \nunder supervisory surveillance and regulation, given the deposit-generating \neffects and their implication for financial stability. While the European Central \nBank (ECB) issued guidance on authorisation requirements for FinTech with \ncredit activities, financial authorities in the UK encourages such firms to obtain \na banking license with a view of bringing them under existing regulations \n(Rodríguez & Ortún, 2020). \n2) Regulation on Payments and Other Store-of Value Services \nOne great example of this regulation is the extension of the regulatory \nperimeter of Payment Service Directives (PSD) by the European Union (EU) to \ncover services beyond the existing payment initiation services (PIS) and \naggregation of information services (AIS) to include services of electronic \nmoney institutions (EMIs)."}

They are only allowed to hold client money when they issue \nelectronic money that is equal to the fiat currency deposited by the client. In \naddition, they are not allowed to intermediate or invest customers’ funds \n(Rodríguez & Ortún, 2020). \n3) Lending \nFinTech and BigTech issuing credits with their own funds are regulated under \nthe existing policy framework governing non-bank financial institutions \nproviders of credit. This framework does not cover those with platforms that \nmerely connect borrowers and lenders such as P2P lending and crowdfunding \nas they are separately regulated (Rodríguez & Ortún, 2020). \n \nIV.3.2 Macroprudential Approach to Regulating BigTech \nGiven their scale factor and the implication of their store-of-value services, \nBigTech are required to deposit these funds with commercial banks, as a way \nof safeguarding customers’ funds. BigTech credits are so huge that their \nlending activities have to be subjected to regular existing regulatory \nframework or macroprudential policies. \n \nIV.4 \nMacroprudential Regulation of Digital Finance in Nigeria \nIn Nigeria, relevant financial authorities including the CBN, SEC and NCC have \nissued guidance and frameworks to manage financial digitalisation process \nto ensure that the process does not undermine the macroprudential stability \nof the Nigerian financial system. Some of these regulations include: \nIV.4.1 The CBN Framework for Regulatory Sandbox Operations, 2021 \nThe CBN in 2021, issued the Framework for Regulatory Sandbox Operation that \ndefines the establishment, rules, and operations of a Regulatory Sandbox for \nthe Nigerian Payments System.

Presently, only 32 million \nout of the 81 million hectares of arable land is under cultivation and typical farm size \nranges between 0.5 hectares and 4 hectares in the southern and northern parts of \nthe country, respectively. \nEven though food is seemingly abundant in Nigeria and also in Africa, many citizens \nstill go to bed hungry. We need to interrogate why this scenario is playing out. \nDespite numerous policies that had been and are still being implemented under \nvarious administrations, Nigeria, and Africa at large are yet to achieve food and \nnutrition security. According to official statistics, Nigeria contributes 58.0 per cent to \nthe global hunger problem. About 14 million go hungry daily in the country. Also, \nabout 12.1 million people are hungry or malnourished. While some people couldn’t \nsleep because of hunger, others, the rich and well fed, could not sleep because of \nthe fear of the hungry. \nTo this end, policies are enacted as a deliberate plan of action to guide decisions \nand achieve national outcomes. Policies usually consist of principles and rules \ngoverning the behaviour of persons in an organisation. Policies prescribe how \npeople in an organisation should act or behave (Asiabaka, 2002). Agricultural (food \nsecurity) policies are statements of actions and fundamental tools employed in \nachieving agricultural development (FBN, 1997). A programme on the other hand is \na comprehensive plan that includes objectives to be attained, specification of \nresources required and stages of work to be performed (Asiabaka, 2002). Elaborate \nplans are called programmes (Kirkpatrik, 1987). Both policies and technology must \nbe effectively deployed to tackle food insecurity. Policy environment must be right \nfor the technology to be effective. The outcome of any effective policy should \nengender productivity, sustainability and resilience in the food and nutrition sector. \n \n Dr. Rasaq Oyeleke, is the Head, Food and Nutrition, Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural \nDevelopment (FMA&RD), Abuja.

These were either pre or post Nigeria independence. \nThese instruments have either directly or indirectly targeted the agricultural sector. \nIII.1 Cooperatives (Established in 1935) \n \nThe Nigerian cooperatives ordinance was promulgated in 1935 to regulate \ncooperative activities in the country. In 1974 a law was enacted which established \nthe Department of Cooperatives. Policy inconsistency and administrative \ndislocations of the Federal Department in charge of cooperatives affected the \nprogress of cooperatives in Nigeria. \n \nIII.2 Commodity Boards (Established 1947) \n \nCommodity marketing boards started during the colonial era with the establishment \nof First-Generation Marketing Boards as follows: Cocoa Marketing Board in 1947, \nPalm Produce, Groundnut and Cotton Marketing Boards in 1949. The second \ngeneration established in 1954 were the Regional Marketing Boards. They served as \nbuyers of last resort, at fixed prices and held strategic or buffer stock. Inability to pay \nfarmers the subsisting market price was the weak link. Regional Marketing Boards \nwere scrapped in 1986 under the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP). \n \nIII.3 Agricultural Research Institutes (Established in 1964) \n \nObjectives were to increase the yields of seed varieties and enhance fertilizer use, \npromote extension, and credit services, as well as adaptive research and staff \ntraining. A number of National crop centres were established at different locations, \nfor instance Ibadan for rice and maize and Zaria for sorghum, millet and wheat and \nUmudike for cassava. It started very well, but the wheat programme was affected \nby a basic withdrawal of political support and lifting of the ban on wheat import."}

It was \naimed at providing subsidised credit at single digit interest rate without the \ncorresponding subsidy provided by government. There was a dire need to reform \nthe institution for greater efficiency and effectiveness in resource mobilisation and \ncredit delivery. Consequently, NACB was merged with People’s Bank of Nigeria and \nthe risk assets of the Family Economic Advancement Programme (FEAP) to form the \nNigerian Agricultural Cooperative and Rural Development Bank (NACRDB), \nincorporated in the year 2000. \n \nIII.5 Agricultural Development Projects, ADPs (Established in 1975) \n \nThis was a World Bank funded project at the inception. ADP revolution started in \n1974 with the establishment in Gombe, Funtua and Gusau. They were set up to \nprovide extension services, technical input support and rural infrastructure services. \nThough they were set up to perform temporary role in providing extension, the ADPs \nhave literally assumed a permanent status. They are now recognised as the major \nagricultural development institutions in the states. The decline in oil prices that \nstarted in 1982 had a substantial fiscal effect on the Nigeria’s revenue and led to \nshortages of counterpart funding of these projects. The emphasis on modern \ntechnology in the ADPs led their agricultural research and extension services to \nfocus on relatively high input technology for sole cropping systems. These systems \nwere not used by most smallholders who used mixed/relay cropping systems as a \nrational strategy to reduce risk. The extension methods changed from the training \nand demonstration system to the training and visit (T&V) system which was slow, \nresulting in top down rather than responsive recommendations to farmers. \n \nIII.6 River Basin Development Authorities, RBDAs (Established in 1977) \n \nThe major instrument of the water resources and irrigation policy was the \nestablishment of 11 RBDAs in 1977 to develop and take advantage of available \nwater bodies in the county for agriculture, fishing, and other purposes. The failure of \nthe RBDAs was due to unnecessary political interference and managerial problems \nresulting from socioeconomic cleavages which permeated the nation’s socio-\npolitical, economic, and cultural institutions, as well as inadequate qualified \nmanpower to provide effective leadership at the departmental levels. \n \nIII.7 National Accelerated Food Production Programme, NAFPP (Introduced in 1972) \nThe Programme was designed to, among others; boost yields of food and cash \ncrops for local consumption and export through; facilitating large scale irrigation \nschemes; promoting grain production on national farms; giving budgetary"}

The Operation \nFeed the Nation (OFN) under General Obasanjo Administration aimed at \nmaximising national welfare through; increase food production to feed the teeming \npopulation; boosting the nation’s balance of payments position; taming inflation; \nand address shortage and poor nutrition. The lack of continuity and shift in \napproach by successive governments were among the reasons for the failure of this \nfood and poverty alleviation programme. \n \nIII.9 Green Revolution (Introduced in 1979) \n \nThe core objectives of this programme include ensuring adequate reliable and safe \nfood supplies for a rapidly growing population; becoming self-reliant in basic food \nrequirements; raising and stabilising the national standards of Nigeria; ensuring \nstability in food commodity markets; and fair and reasonable levels and distribution \nof income among food producers. The programme focussed on food production, \ninput supply and subsidy, special commodity development, review of agricultural \ncredit guaranteed scheme and increase resource allocation to River Basin \nDevelopment Authorities (RBDAs). This programme like other previous ones suffered \ncontinuity and shift in approach by successive government. \n \nIII.10 Back to Land Agricultural Policy (Introduced in 1983) \n \nThe principal objectives of the programme include self-sufficiency in food \nproduction through the promotion of massive agricultural food production and \npoverty alleviation; safe food supplies for a rapidly growing population; self-reliant \nin basic food requirements; and ensuring stability in food commodity markers. The \nprogramme introduced modern input for increased agricultural productivity; \nprovided loans to small- and large-scale farmers through the Agricultural Credit \nGuarantee Scheme (ACGS), commercial banks and the Nigeria Agricultural \nCooperative Bank (NACB); and supplied financial incentives to commercial farmers \nwith intent to fund large scale production.

It was originally designed as supra ministerial body for channelling \nthe proceeds of the liberalised foreign exchange market for rural development. The \nmain aims/objectives were provision of food to feed the teeming population; open \nup the rural areas in order to reduce transport inhibitions and provide motorable \nfeeder roads; and provide basic, social and economic infrastructures like electricity, \nportable drinking water and other essential facilities to make rural areas very \nattractive to inhabit. However, lack of funds and commitment limited the extent of \ninfrastructural provision in the rural areas. The government rural infrastructural \nprogrammes were embarked upon without effective programme of action and \nappropriate institutional arrangements for their execution. \n \nIII.12 National Fadama Development Project, NFDP (Introduced in 1993) \n \nThis was a comprehensive action plan aimed at addressing the challenges of \npoverty in Nigeria through; sustainable increase in the incomes of Fadama users \nusing simple and low-cost improved irrigation technology and focusing on crop \nproduction, processing, preservation and conservation, and rural infrastructure. The \nproject was significantly supported and financed by the World Bank. Fadama \nProject partly accounted for a boost in the food security of the country in late 1990s. \n \nIII.13 National Agricultural Land Development Authority, NALDA (Established in 1991) \n \nThe NALDA provided strategic public support for land development, promoting, \nand supporting optimum utilisation of Nigeria’s rural land resources, providing \ngainful employment opportunities for rural people as well as raising incomes and \nimproving general living standards in rural areas. The NALDA approach rather than \nreduce the direct public provisions of goods and services which could be provided \nby the private sector instead did not stop the public provision of goods and services. \nMany of NALDA’s services were duplications, albeit on a more intensive basis of \nservices provided by the ADPs. \n \nIII.14 Presidential Initiative on Cocoa, Cassava, Rice, Livestock, Fisheries, \nVegetables (Introduced in 1999) \nThese were initiated by the Obasanjo administration to improve Nigeria’s food \nproduction in line with Vision 2020. The strategy is to attract the attention of the \nhighest level of political authority for special intervention in the commodity sector. \nWeaknesses of poor funding and lack of institutional arrangements for \nimplementation marred the successes recorded."}

Key features \nof ATA include GES (Growth Enhancement Support Scheme) and Commodity Value \nChain (CVC) which had been acclaimed to be the most successful. ATA also \nestablished several Staple Crops Export Processing Zones. \nKey Constraints and challenges of ATA: Insufficient access to improved variety \nseeds; Credit access particularly for smallholders was weak; Growth in food \nproduction was limited due to gaps in input supplies; Limited investment inflows into \ninfrastructure and midstream logistics and growth in food production remained due \nto gaps in input supplies e.g. rice; hence rice imports still exceeded $1 billion per \nannum, as well as refusal by state governments to recognise input suppliers \napproved by the Federal Government under the GES scheme."}

Over the years, the Nigeria \nfinancial landscape had undergone considerable and positive transformation, nonetheless, \nsome risks are apparent. The Nigeria Foreign Exchange Code (FX Code) was in response to \nthese developments to set out standards to holistically strengthen and promote the integrity and \neffective functioning of the wholesale foreign exchange (FX) market in Nigeria. It will \nfacilitate better functioning of the market, further reinforcing Nigeria’s flexible exchange rate \nregime. \nThe FX Code is expected to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent \nMarket in which a diverse set of Market Participants, supported by resilient infrastructure, can \nconfidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect available market \ninformation in a manner that conforms to acceptable global behavioral standards and best \npractices. \nThe FX Code applies to Market Participants. These are Authorised Dealers licensed by the \nCentral Bank of Nigeria under the CBN Act 2007, and, the Bank and Other Financial \nInstitutions Act (BOFIA) 2020 and other participants that engage in the wholesale foreign \nexchange business in Nigeria as part of their licensed business. \nThe FX Code is structured around six (6) leading principles: \ni. \nEthics: Market Participants are expected to behave in an ethical and \nprofessional manner to promote the fairness and integrity of the FX market. \nii. \nGovernance: Market Participants are expected to have a sound and \neffective governance framework to provide for clear responsibility for and \ncomprehensive oversight of their FX market activities and to promote \nresponsible engagement in the FX market. \niii. \nExecution: Market Participants are expected to exercise care when \nnegotiating and executing transactions to promote a robust, fair, open, liquid, \nand appropriately transparent FX market. \niv. \nInformation Sharing: Market Participants are expected to be clear and \naccurate in their communications and to protect confidential information to \npromote effective communication that supports a robust, fair, open, liquid, \nand appropriately transparent FX market. \nv. \nRisk Management and Compliance: Market Participants are expected to \npromote and maintain a robust controlled and compliance environment to \neffectively identify, manage, and report on the risks associated with their \nengagement in the FX market. \nvi. Confirmation and Settlement Processes: Market Participants are \nexpected to put in place robust, efficient, transparent, and risk-mitigating \npost-trade processes to promote predictable, smooth, and timely settlement \nof transactions in the FX market."}

In addition, some principles were incorporated in the Nigerian FX Code \nto promote efficiency in the Nigeria FX market. \nThe FX Code requires Market Participants to ensure that illegal financial transfers are avoided, \nand appropriate money laundering policies put in place to protect the integrity of the domestic \nmarkets and the global financial framework as a whole. \nIn the context of the FX Code, the term “Market Participant” is generally used to refer to banks, \npersonnel, and other approved institutions. In some cases, it will be clear that a principle is by \nits nature more relevant to only one or the other. For example, certain principles deal primarily \nwith business or banks-level policies and procedures rather than individual behaviors. The \nterms “banks” and “personnel” are occasionally used where principles focus on good practice \nby banks with regard to personnel in their capacity as such, and vice versa. \n \nThe FX Global Code, available on https://www.globalfxc.org/docs/fx_global.pdf is a set of \nglobally acceptable standards that foster good practice in the foreign exchange market which \nhas been supported in 51 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. The Global Code \nis maintained by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC) as a set of guidelines to \nensure a well-functioning wholesale foreign exchange market that is effective and promotes \nintegrity. The GFXC was established in May 2017 as a forum to bring together central banks \nand private sector participants to promote collaboration and communication on FX matters, \nexchange views on trends and developments in FX markets as well as, promote, maintain and \nupdate the Global Code. The GFXC assesses regularly whether foreign exchange market \ndevelopments warrant specific revisions to the Global Code and when judged appropriate, \nundertakes a comprehensive review of the Global Code. The Global Code is intended to foster \na high standard of conduct and good market practices, ensure equitable and healthy \nrelationships between participants, and facilitate market efficiency. \n \nNigeria pursues a flexible exchange rate regime, and the value of the Nigeria naira (N) is \ndetermined by market forces according to the demand and supply of foreign exchange. The FX \nCode is being developed to respond to emerging issues and address the dynamic nature of the \nfinancial markets and specifically address emerging challenges in the foreign exchange market. \nThis set of principles of good practice in the foreign exchange market would provide a common \ncode of practice to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the foreign exchange \nmarket in Nigeria. Specifically, it would promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately \ntransparent market in which a diverse set of Market Participants, supported by resilient \ninfrastructure can confidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect \navailable market information and in a manner that conforms to acceptable behavioural \nstandards. \n \nWhile every effort has been made to ensure that this FX Code comprehensively addresses \nvarious aspects of conduct and market practice, it does not purport to be exhaustive.

Execution \nLEADING PRINCIPLE: Market Participants are expected to exercise care when negotiating \nand executing transactions in order to promote a robust, fair, open, liquid, and appropriately \ntransparent FX market. \nThe FX execution landscape is diverse, with execution taking place through authorized \nchannels and with Market Participants taking on different roles with regard to that execution. \nAll FX Market Participants, regardless of their role in the execution of transactions, should \nbehave with integrity to support the effective functioning of the FX market. \n \nPRINCIPLE 8: Market Participants should be clear about the capacities in which they \nact. \nMarket Participants should understand and clearly communicate their roles and capacities in \nmanaging orders or executing transactions. Market Participants may have a standing agreement \nor other terms of business as to their roles that govern all trades, or they may manage their \nrelationship by determining their roles on a trade-by-trade basis. If a Market Participant wishes \nto vary the capacity in which it or its counterpart acts, any such alternative arrangement should \nbe agreed by both parties. \nA Market Participant receiving a client order may: \n \n8.1 \nact as an Agent, executing orders on behalf of the client pursuant to the \nclient mandate, and without taking on market risk in connection with the \norder; or \n8.2 \nact as a Principal taking on one or more risks in connection with an order, \nincluding credit risk and varying degrees of market risk. Principals act on \ntheir own behalf and there is no obligation to execute the order until both \nparties are in agreement. Where the acceptance of an order grants the \nPrincipal executing the order some discretion, it should exercise this \ndiscretion reasonably, fairly, and in such a way that is not designed or \nintended to disadvantage the client. \nMarket Participants operating FX E-Trading Platforms should establish regular internal audits \nof trading practices to mitigate conflict of interest. \n \nPRINCIPLE 9: Market Participants should handle orders fairly and with transparency \nin line with the capacities in which they act. \nMarket Participants are expected to handle orders with fairness and transparency.

Other measures to manage counterparty credit risk \ninclude the accurate and timely assessment of a counterparty’s creditworthiness prior to a trans- \naction, sufficient diversification of counterparty exposure where appropriate, the prompt \nsetting and monitoring of counterparty exposure limits, and the acceptance of transactions only \nif they fall within approved limits. Credit limits should be set independently of the front office \nand should reflect the established risk appetite of the Market Participant. \nMarket Participants should maintain accurate records material to their counterparty \nrelationships. This could include records of conversations and written correspondence, and \nretention policies should be aligned with Applicable Law. \nFX E-Trading Platforms that have multiple liquidity providers and consumers should at a \nminimum disclose the following as it relates to credit monitoring: \n27.1 what mechanisms and/or controls are in place to set, amend, and monitor \nall applicable credit limits; \n27.2 whether and how the responsibility of monitoring credit limit breaches \nfalls upon the platform or the users, and which parties are responsible for \nresolving credit limit breaches; and \n27.3 what specific methodologies are used to calculate credit exposures (such \nas Net Open Position, etc.). \nMARKET RISK \nPRINCIPLE 28: Market Participants should have processes to measure, monitor, report, \nand manage market risk in an accurate and timely way. \nChanges in FX prices or rates give rise to market risk, which could have an adverse effect on \nthe financial condition of Market Participants. Market risk measurement should be based on \ngenerally accepted measurement techniques and concepts, including the use of stress testing. \nSuch measurement techniques should be periodically and independently reviewed. The \nmeasurement of market risk should take into account hedging and diversification effects. \nMarket Participants should be aware of, monitor, and where appropriate mitigate the \nliquidity risk that could arise from their transactions in the FX market. \n \nPRINCIPLE 29: Market Participants should have independent processes in place to \nmark-to-market trading positions to measure the size of their profit and loss and the \nmarket risk arising from trading positions."}

Any agreements between the parties to use electronic dealing \nplatforms for trade matching rather than exchanging traditional \nconfirmation messages should be documented in the legal agreement \nbetween the parties. \n \nPRINCIPLE 44: Market Participants should review, affirm, and allocate block \ntransactions as soon as practicable. \nBlock transaction details should be reviewed and affirmed as soon as practicable following \nexecution. Investment managers or others acting as Agent on behalf of multiple counterparties \nmay undertake block transactions that are subsequently allocated to specific underlying \ncounterparties.

Market Participants should set binding ex ante limits and use controls equivalent to \nother credit exposures of similar size and duration to the same counterparty. When a decision \nis made to allow a client to exceed a limit, appropriate approval should be obtained. \nWhere settlement amounts are to be netted, the initial confirmation of trades to be netted should \nbe performed as it would be for any other FX transaction. All initial trades should be confirmed \nbefore they are included in a netting calculation. In the case of bilateral netting, processes for \nnetting settlement values used by Market Participants should also include a procedure for \nconfirming the bilateral net amounts in each currency at a predetermined cut-off point that has \nbeen agreed upon with the relevant counterparty. \nTo avoid underestimating the size and duration of exposures, Market Participants should \nrecognize that settlement risk exposure to their counterparty begins when a payment order on \nthe currency it sold can no longer be recalled or cancelled with certainty, which may be before \nthe settlement date. Market Participants should also recognize that funds might not have been \nreceived until it is confirmed that the trade has settled with finality during the reconciliation \nprocess. \n \nPRINCIPLE 48: Market Participants should utilise Standing Settlement Instructions \n(SSIs) \nSSIs for all relevant products and currencies should be in place, where practicable, for \ncounterparties with whom a Market Participant has a trading relationship. The responsibility \nfor entering, authenticating, and maintaining SSIs should reside with personnel clearly \nsegregated from a Market Participant’s trading and sales personnel and ideally from those \noperational personnel responsible for trade settlement. SSIs should be securely stored and \nprovided to all relevant settlement systems so as to facilitate straight-through processing. The \nuse of multiple SSIs with the same counterparty for a given product and currency is \ndiscouraged. Because of the settlement risks it introduces, the use of multiple SSIs with the \nsame counterparty for a given product and currency should have appropriate controls. \nSSIs should be set up with a defined start date and captured and amended (including audit trail \nrecording) with the appropriate approvals, such as review by at least two individuals. \nCounterparties should be notified of changes to SSIs with sufficient time in advance of their \nimplementation. Changes, notifications, and new SSIs should be delivered via an authenticated, \nand standardised, message type whenever possible. \nAll transactions should be settled in accordance with the SSIs in force on the value date. Trades \nthat are outstanding at the time SSIs are changed (and have a value date on or after the start \ndate for the new SSIs) should be reconfirmed prior to settlement (either bilaterally or through \nan authenticated message broadcast). \nWhere SSIs are not available (or existing SSIs are not appropriate to the particular trade), the \nalternate settlement instructions to be used should be delivered as soon as practicable. These \ninstructions should be exchanged via an authenticated message or other secure means and \nsubsequently verified as part of the trade confirmation process."}

Market \nParticipants engaging in third-party payments should have clearly formulated policies \nregarding their use and any such payments should comply with such policies. \nAt a minimum, these policies should require the payer to be furnished with a clear \nunderstanding of the reasons for third-party payments and for risk assessments to be made in \nrespect of anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, and other Applicable Law. \nArrangements for third-party payments should also be agreed upon and documented between \nthe counterparties prior to trading. In the event a third-party payment is requested after a trade \nhas been executed, the same level of due diligence should be exercised, and relevant \ncompliance and risk approvals should be sought and secured. \n \nPRINCIPLE 50: Market Participants should have adequate systems in place to allow \nthem to project, monitor, and manage their intraday and end-of-day funding \nrequirements to reduce potential complications during the settlement process. \nMarket Participants should appropriately manage their funding needs and ensure that they are \nable to meet their FX payment obligations on time. A Market Participant’s failure to meet its \nFX payment obligations in a timely manner may impair the ability of one, or more, \ncounterparties to complete their own settlement, and may lead to liquidity dislocations and \ndisruptions in the payment and settlement systems. \nMarket Participants should have clear procedures outlining how each of their accounts used for \nthe settlement of FX transactions is to be funded.

Market Participants should communicate expected receipts (via \nstandardized message types, when possible) to allow nostro banks to identify and correct \npayment errors on a timely basis and aid in the formulation of escalation procedures. \nMarket Participants should communicate with their nostro banks to process the cancellations \nand amendments of payment instructions. Market Participants should understand when they \ncan unilaterally cancel or amend payment instructions and should negotiate with their nostro \nbanks to make these cut-off times as close as possible to the start of the settlement cycle in the \nrelevant currencies. \n \nIV. \nAccount Reconciliation Processes \nPRINCIPLE 51: Market Participants should perform timely account reconciliation \nprocesses. \nMarket Participants should conduct a regular reconciliation process to reconcile expected cash \nflows against actual cash flows on a timely basis.

What is the Electronic Foreign Exchange Matching System (EFEMS)? \n \nEFEMS is an electronic platform introduced by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for \nconducting foreign exchange (FX) transactions in the Nigerian Foreign Exchange \nMarket (NFEM). It is designed to match buy and sell orders automatically, enhancing \ntransparency and governance in FX trading. \n \n \n2. When will EFEMS be implemented? \n \nEFEMS will be fully implemented in the interbank foreign exchange market by \nDecember 1, 2024. A two-week test run will take place in November 2024 to ensure \nsmooth integration and operation. \n \n \n3. What are the key benefits of adopting EFEMS for Nigeria’s FX trade? \n \n- EFEMS provides real-time pricing and visibility of buy/sell orders, reducing the \nopacity in the FX market. \n- Automated matching of orders ensures that market participants transact at the \nbest available prices, reducing price manipulation and market distortions. \n- The system limits speculative trading and reduces the volatility caused by \nmarket distortions. \n- It enhances oversight, allowing better regulation and monitoring of FX \nactivities. \n- Real-time data will be accessible to the public, contributing to a more informed \nand efficient market. \n \n4. How will EFEMS work in the Nigerian foreign exchange market? \n \nAuthorised Dealers will use EFEMS to place buy and sell orders in real time. The \nsystem will automatically match corresponding orders based on predetermined rules, \nensuring swift execution of transactions. All transactions will be reflected immediately \nin the system for market participants and regulators. \n \n5. What changes will EFEMS bring to the current FX trading process? \n \nEFEMS replaces the manual or less-automated trading processes with a streamlined, \nfully electronic system. It introduces real-time transaction visibility and ensures that all \ntrades are processed through a single, regulated platform. This eliminates inefficiencies \nand manual interventions that may previously have led to market distortions. \n \n6. What impact will EFEMS have on market rates? \n \nEFEMS is expected to promote a market-driven exchange rate. This means rates will \nreflect actual market conditions, leading to a more efficient and stable pricing \nmechanism in the Nigerian FX market. \n \n7. Will EFEMS affect speculative activities in the FX market? \n \nYes, EFEMS is expected to reduce speculative activities by ensuring that all trades are \nconducted transparently and in real time. This minimizes the opportunity for traders to \nexploit market inefficiencies or create artificial price movements."}

Who will oversee and regulate EFEMS? \n \nThe CBN, in collaboration with the Financial Markets Dealers Association (FMDA), \nwill regulate the system. They will publish guidelines, rules, and real-time data to \nensure compliance with the Nigerian FX Code and the revised Market Operating \nGuidelines for the Nigeria Foreign Exchange Market. \n \n9. How can Authorized Dealers prepare for the adoption of EFEMS? \n \nAuthorised Dealers are required to ensure that all necessary documentation, training, \nand system integration efforts are completed before the go-live date. Dealers should \nfamiliarize themselves with the Nigerian FX Code and the revised guidelines to comply \nwith regulatory requirements. \n \n10. What role will the public play in the EFEMS framework? \n \nThe public will benefit from improved transparency, as real-time market prices and data \nwill be accessible. This allows market participants, businesses, and individuals to make \nmore informed decisions when engaging in foreign exchange transactions. \n \n11. How will EFEMS contribute to Nigeria’s FX market stability? \n \nEFEMS will help eliminate speculative activities and price manipulation. It ensures that \nFX rates reflect actual demand and supply conditions, leading to improved market \nstability and better regulation. \n \n12. The FX market currently trades on Refinitiv FXT. How will the adoption of \nEFEMS affect that? \n \nWith the introduction of EFEMS, Authorized Dealers (ADBs) will transition from the \ncurrent trading platform (Refinitiv FXT) to EFEMS for all interbank FX transactions. \nEFEMS will become the central platform for trade execution and matching, ensuring \nall trades are conducted under the CBN’s new governance framework. However, the \nexisting platforms like Refinitiv FXT may still serve as supplementary tools for \nconversational dealings. \n \n13. How will EFEMS promote price discovery in the Nigerian FX market? \n \nEFEMS will enhance price discovery by providing real-time visibility into buy and sell \norders across the market, allowing all participants to see the true demand and supply \nfor foreign exchange and exchange rates reflecting actual market conditions, rather than \nbeing influenced by speculative behaviour or market distortions. \n \n14. What matching platform is being proposed: can this be communicated to the \nmarket in writing? \nThe CBN is yet to announce the specific platform selected for EFEMS. Platforms such \nas Bloomberg, Refinitv and EBS all offer matching solutions, but the final decision \nwould be communicated to the market in writing. \n \n15. Scope of trade to be dealt on the EFEMS (all FX or Just Interbank)? \nEFEMS is expected to cover all FX transactions including interbank and trades \nwith clients."}

Are banks still allowed to voice trade or close bilateral outside the EFEMS \nplatform? \n \nNo, all FX transactions, including bilateral deals and clients’ trades must be conducted \nthrough EFEMS. This is to ensure market-driven pricing. Exceptions (if, any) will be \noutlined in the system’s operating guidelines. \n \n18. What’s the contingency plan for business continuity in the event of EFEMs \nfailure/glitch? Can the market fall back to usual conventional means of closing \ntrades? \nA robust contingency plan will be in place in case of system failures. The market is still \nexpected to maintain access to the conventional dealings as alternative options where \nthere is need to do so. This will be with permission of the CBN. \n \n19. CBN said they will publish real time rates etc, on what platform will those be \npublished. Will the published rate be considered as of reference rates for the \nprevailing rate of USDNGN? If so, any details on how the CBN intends on \ncomputing the rate before they publish would be beneficial. \n \nReal-time rate and other key data from EFEMS will be published on the selected \nplatform as well as the CBN official websites and other financial information services. \nThe rates would serve as reference rate for USDNGN and the methodology for \ncomputing and updating these rates will be communicated to market participants."}

The continuous maintenance of such accounts \nresults to accumulation of huge unclaimed balances at the disposal of the financial \ninstitutions for which the depositors may not be adequately compensated. In addition, \ndormant and unclaimed balances are increasingly susceptible to fraudulent \ntransactions or abuse. \nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on October 7, 2015, issued Guidelines on the \nManagement of Dormant Accounts and Other Unclaimed Balances by Banks and \nOther Financial Institutions in Nigeria, to curb abuses in the operation of dormant and \ninactive accounts and set operational standards. To strengthen the oversight functions \nof CBN on the management of dormant and unclaimed balances, the Banks and Other \nFinancial Institutions Act, 2020 (BOFIA 2020) made explicit provisions on unclaimed \nfunds or abandoned properties in FIs under the regulatory purview of the CBN. \nThis Guidelines is, therefore, issued pursuant to the powers conferred on the CBN \nGovernor by the CBN Act 2007 and BOFIA 2020 and supersedes the 2015 Guidelines \non the Management of Dormant Accounts and Other Unclaimed Balances by Banks \nand Other Financial Institutions in Nigeria."}

In the global environment, the key risks remain the increased \ngeopolitical tensions which have continued to exert upward pressure on \ncommodity prices, resulting in slow economic recovery. In particular, the direction \nof crude oil prices remains largely uncertain as the tensions in the Middle East persist \nimplying that energy prices may continue to fluctuate in the short to medium term. \nWhile major central banks have commenced normalization of monetary policy, \nglobal financial conditions have remained broadly tight as inflationary pressures \ncontinue to abate moderately. \nIn the domestic economy, exchange rate pressures and price development have \nbeen the major challenge to monetary policy. With continued demand pressure on \nthe exchange rate, the Bank has been focused on moderating volatility through a \nwilling-buyer, willing-seller framework as well as settling of verified foreign exchange \nbacklogs to boost market confidence. Inflationary pressure has however, continued \ndue to the rise in energy prices, especially the price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS). \nThis is being reflected in the increased cost of transportation which is directly \ntransmitted to food and other commodities. Notwithstanding the downside risks, \noutput growth recovery was sustained in the review period. Data from the National \nBureau of Statistics (NBS) showed that real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew by \n2.31 per cent (year-on-year) in the first quarter of 2024 and rise tepidly to 2.51 per \ncent (year-on-year) in the second quarter.\nIn the financial market, liquidity conditions continued to influence rates in the money \nmarket. The upward trends in money market rates during the review period reflected \nthe impact of tight monetary policy to curtail money supply growth and moderate \ninflationary pressure. The performance of the Nigerian capital market was positive \nduring the review period, aptly reflecting continued investor confidence in the \neconomy. Consequently, the All-Share Index (ASI) increased by 33.81 per cent to \n100,057.49 in June 2024, from 74,773.77 at the end of December 2023. \nThe conduct of monetary policy in the review period focused on anchoring inflation \nexpectations and moderating exchange rate pressures with an eye on stimulating \ngrowth performance. Consequently, monetary policy assumed a hawkish stance \nduring the review period, with the Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) increased by a \ncumulative 750 basis points to 26.25 per cent. The asymmetric corridor around the \nMPR was maintained at +100/-300 basis points; Cash Reserve Ratio of Other \nvii"}

The developments include \nglobal and domestic output, prices, \nmonetary \npolicy \nand \nliquidity \nmanagement as well as the financial \nmarket. \n \nOn the global scene, monetary and \nfinancial conditions remained relatively \ntight even though central banks in the \nadvanced \neconomies \ncommenced \npolicy normalisation, while emerging \nmarket central banks maintained higher \nrates. This trend was driven by persistent \ninflationary \npressures, \nwhich \nnecessitated a cautious approach to \npolicy normalisation. Specifically, in the \nadvanced economies, major central \nbanks such as the US FED and the ECB \nmaintained relatively high policy rates \ndespite guidance of gradual policy \nnormalisation due to the slow but steady \ndescent of inflation. Similarly, central \nbanks in emerging market economies \nmaintained a tight policy stance due to \npersistent inflationary pressure, as several \ncountries in the group continued to \nexperience rising inflation. \n \nOn \nthe \ndomestic \nfront, \nseveral \ndevelopments contributed to liquidity \nsurfeit in the banking system and the real \neconomy. Notable amongst these are \nthe \nimpact \nof \nexchange \nrate \nrevaluation \non \nforeign \ncurrency \nbalances of domestic banks, increase in \nFederation \nAccount \nAllocation \nCommittee (FAAC) disbursement to the \nthree tiers of government from the \nmonetised proceeds of crude oil taxes \nand \nroyalties, \nmonetisation \nof \nGovernment foreign currency loans and \nmaturing OMO bills. These liquidity \nsources contributed to inflationary and \nexchange rate pressures. \n \nAccordingly, \ninflationary \npressures \npersisted in the first half of 2024. This was \nexacerbated \nby \ncontinued \ncapital \noutflows as policy rates in advanced \neconomies remained high, resulting in \npersisting exchange rate pressure with a \npassthrough to domestic prices. In \naddition, security challenges in food \nproducing areas continued to hamper \nfood \nproduction \nand \ndistribution. \nConsequently, all three measures of \ninflation (headline, food, and core) \ntrended \nupwards, \nreflecting \nthe \ncombined effect of various demand \nand \nsupply-side \nfactors. \nHeadline \ninflation (year-on-year) increased by \n4.28 percentage points to 34.19 per cent \nin June 2024 from 29.90 per cent in \nJanuary. Similarly, core inflation rose by \n3.81 percentage points to 27.40 per cent \nin June 2024 from 23.59 per cent in \nJanuary. Food inflation rose significantly \nby 5.46 percentage points to 40.87 per \ncent in June 2024 from 35.41 per cent in \nJanuary. \nIn \nterms \nof \noutput, \nthe \nNigerian \neconomy maintained a positive growth \ntrajectory in the first half of 2024.

In the \nEuro area, growth is projected to \nrecover from 0.5 per cent in 2023 to 0.9 \nper cent in 2024, driven by stronger \nmomentum in services and increased \nnet exports, leading to rising wages and \nstronger \nhousehold \nconsumption. \nInvestment in this block of economies is \nalso expected to improve as monetary \npolicy easing gradually impacts on the \ncost of capital. Germany, a major \neconomy in the block is, however, \nconfronted \nwith \nshocks \nto \nits \nmanufacturing \nindustry \nwhich \nmay \nimpose a drag on the zone’s broad \nrecovery.

This, in the view of Members \nreflected the impact of the Bank’s \nrecent policy actions and reforms, as \nwell as increased transparency in the \nmarket.

This \nfollows a decline (month-on-month) of \nthe headline and food measures in \nMarch 2024, suggesting that the recent \ntight stance of policy was beginning to \nyield results. \n \nMembers further observed the recent \nvolatility in the foreign exchange market, \nattributing this to seasonal demand, a \nreflection of the interplay between \ndemand \nand \nsupply \nin \na \nfreely \nfunctioning market system. \n \nThe Committee noted with satisfaction \nthat the banking system remains safe, \nsound, \nand \nstable, \ndespite \nthe \nheadwinds confronting the economy.

The \nCommittee, therefore, was of the view \nthat addressing food insecurity is key to \ncontaining current inflationary pressures. \nOn this note, Members commended the \nongoing \nefforts \nof \nthe \nFederal \nGovernment towards addressing food \ninsecurity, some of these measures \ninclude \nthe \nprovision \nof \nvarious \npalliatives, release of grains from the \nstrategic reserves, distribution of seeds \nand fertilisers, as well as farm implements \nfor dry season farming. \n \nThe Committee therefore called for the \nfull implementation of the Federal \nGovernment’s agricultural policies and \nprogrammes to improve food supply \nand further advised for broader fiscal \nconsolidation \nparticularly \non \nthe \nimprovements of tax collection and tax-\nto-GDP ratio. \n \nThe Committee noted with satisfaction \nthe level of stability achieved in the \nforeign exchange market in the last few \nweeks.

The MPC also enjoined the \nBank \nto \nexpedite \naction \non \nthe \nrecapitalisation of banks to strengthen \nthe system against potential risks in an \nincreasingly \nglobalized \nworld. \nConsequently, at this meeting, the MPC \nwas faced with the option of either \nprogressing with its tightening cycle or \nhold, to observe the impact of the \nprevious rate hike and adjustment of the \nCash \nReserve \nRequirement. \nAfter \nreviewing the balance of risks and the \nnear-term inflation outlook, Members \nwere convinced of the need to progress \nwith the tightening cycle. \n \nKey Developments in the Domestic and \nGlobal Economies \nDomestic headline inflation rose further \nto 31.70 per cent in February 2024 from \n29.90 per cent in January.

The MPC urged \nthat more be done to address the \nsecurity of farming communities to \nguarantee improved food production in \nthese areas. \n \nMembers further observed the recent \nvolatility in the foreign exchange market, \nattributing this to seasonal demand, a \nreflection of the interplay between \ndemand \nand \nsupply \nin \na \nfreely \nfunctioning market system. \n \nThe Committee also noted the marginal \nincrease in the external reserve balance \nbetween March and April 2024 and \nurged the Bank to sustain its focus on \naccretion \nto \nreserves. \nThe \nMPC \ncommended the Bank for the recent \napproval of licenses of fourteen (14) \ninternational Money Transfer operators \n(IMTOs). This is expected to improve \ncompetition and lower the cost of \ntransactions, \nthus \nattracting \nmore \nremittances through formal channels. \n \nThe Committee noted with satisfaction \nthat the banking system remains safe,"}

Over the years, the Nigeria \nfinancial landscape has experienced considerable and positive transformation. However, \nweaknesses have also emerged as well as risks. The Nigeria Foreign Exchange Code (FX Code) \nhas been developed in response to these changes and sets out standards which aim to \nholistically strengthen and promote the integrity and effective functioning of the wholesale \nforeign exchange (FX) market in Nigeria. It will facilitate better functioning of the market, \nfurther reinforcing Nigeria’s flexible exchange rate regime. \nThe FX Code is intended to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and appropriately transparent \nMarket in which a diverse set of Market Participants, supported by resilient infrastructure, can \nconfidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect available market \ninformation in a manner that conforms to accepted global standards of behaviour and best \npractices. \nThe FX Code applies to Market Participants. These are banks licensed by the Central Bank of \nNigeria under the CBN Act 2007 and Bank and Other Financial Institutions Act (BOFIA) 2020 \nand engage in the wholesale foreign exchange business in Nigeria as part of their licensed \nbusiness. \nThe FX Code is organised around six leading principles: \n• \nEthics: Market Participants are expected to behave in an ethical and professional \nmanner to promote the fairness and integrity of the FX Market. \n• \nGovernance: Market Participants are expected to have a sound and effective \ngovernance framework to provide for clear responsibility for and comprehensive oversight of \ntheir FX Market activity and to promote responsible engagement in the FX Market. \n• \nExecution: Market Participants are expected to exercise care when negotiating and \nexecuting transactions to promote a robust, fair, open, liquid, and appropriately transparent FX \nMarket. \n• \nInformation Sharing: Market Participants are expected to be clear and accurate in \ntheir communications and to protect Confidential Information to promote effective \ncommunication that supports a robust, fair, open, liquid, and appropriately transparent FX \nMarket. \n• \nRisk Management and Compliance: Market Participants are expected to promote and \nmaintain a robust control and compliance environment to effectively identify, manage, and \nreport on the risks associated with their engagement in the FX Market. \n• \nConfirmation and Settlement Processes: Market Participants are expected to put in \nplace robust, efficient, transparent, and risk-mitigating post-trade processes to promote the \npredictable, smooth, and timely settlement of transactions in the FX Market."}

There are some principles that need to be incorporated in the FX Code to \nensure efficiency in Nigeria market. \nThe FX Code requires Market Participants to ensure that illegal financial transfers are avoided, \nand appropriate money laundering policies put in place to protect the integrity of the domestic \nmarkets and the global financial framework as a whole. \nIn the context of the FX Code, the term Market Participant is generally used to refer to both \nfirms and personnel. However, in some cases it will be clear that a principle is by its nature \nmore relevant to only one or the other. For example, certain principles deal primarily with \nbusiness or firm-level policies and procedures rather than individual behaviours. The terms \n“firm” and “personnel” are occasionally used where principles focus on good practice by firms \nwith regard to personnel in their capacity as such, and vice versa. \nThe FX Global Code, https://www.globalfxc.org/docs/fx_global.pdf is a set of globally \nacceptable standards that fosters good practice in the foreign exchange market which has been \nsupported in 51 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. The Global Code is \nmaintained by Global Foreign Exchange Committee (GFXC) as a set of guidelines to ensure a \nwell-functioning wholesale foreign exchange market that is effective and promotes integrity. \nThe GFXC was established in May 2017 as a forum to bring together central banks and private \nsector participants to promote collaboration and communication on FX matters, exchange \nviews on trends and developments in FX markets as well as promote, maintain and update the \nGlobal Code. The GFXC assesses regularly whether foreign exchange market developments \nwarrant specific revisions to the Global Code and when judged appropriate, undertakes a \ncomprehensive review of the Global Code. The Global Code is intended to foster a high \nstandard of conduct and good market practices, ensure equitable and healthy relationships \nbetween participants, and facilitate market efficiency. \nNigeria pursues a floating exchange rate regime, and the value of the Nigeria naira (N) is \ndetermined by the market forces according to the demand and supply of foreign exchange. The \nFX Code has been developed to respond to emerging issues and address the dynamic nature of \nthe financial markets and specifically address emerging challenges in the foreign exchange \nmarket. \nThis set of principles of good practice in the foreign exchange market has been developed to \nprovide a common code of practice to promote the integrity and effective functioning of the \nforeign exchange market in Nigeria. It is intended to promote a robust, fair, liquid, open, and \nappropriately transparent market in which a diverse set of Market Participants, supported by \nresilient infrastructure can confidently and effectively transact at competitive prices that reflect \navailable market information and in a manner that conforms to acceptable standards of \nbehaviour."}

Where \nspecific standards are absent on a particular issue or in relation to new or emerging financial \nproducts, Market Participants should draw on the broad principles in this FX Code and resolve \nany issues reasonably and in good faith in accordance with the spirit of the FX Code. \nThe foreign exchange interbank market features a diverse set of participants who engage in the \nmarket in different ways and across various foreign exchange products. The FX Code is \ndeveloped with this diversity in mind. The FX Code supported by consistent monetary, \nexchange rate and fiscal policies will maintain competitiveness, support a revitalised interbank \nmarket, protect foreign exchange reserves, and ensure continued financial stability. \nThe CBN acknowledges and greatly appreciates the efforts of all those who contributed to the \nsuccessful preparation of this FX Code. \nCompliance with FX Code \nThe FX Code is issued pursuant to CBN Act 2007 and BOFIA Act 2020 which empowers the \nCentral Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to issue directions with respect to the standards to be adhered \nto by an institution in the conduct of foreign exchange business in Nigeria. \nMarket Participants will be required to conduct a self-assessment and submit to the CBN a \nreport on the institution’s level of compliance with the FX Code by December 31, 2024. All \nMarket Participants will thereafter be required to submit to the CBN a detailed compliance \nimplementation plan that is approved by its Board by December 31, 2024. \nThe FX Code should be fully implemented, and each Market Participant be in full compliance \nby December 31, 2024. \nReporting Mechanisms \nMarket Participants will be required to submit a quarterly report to the Financial Markets \nDepartment (FMD), on the level of compliance to the FX Code within 14 days after the end of \nevery calendar quarter, with the first report due by December 31, 2024. \nEnforcement Mechanisms \nCBN may take appropriate enforcement and other administrative action including monetary \npenalties as provided for under the CBN Act 2007 and BOFIA Act 2020 against any Market \nParticipant for failure to comply with the FX Code. \nEffective Date \nThe Nigerian FX Code is effective from October 14, 2024."}

Market Participants should eliminate these conflicts or, if this is not reasonably \npossible, effectively manage them so as to promote fair treatment of their Clients and other \nMarket Participants, up to and including abstaining from undertaking the relevant activity or \naction due to the conflict of interests.

With this in mind, the principles below outline some of the good practices relevant to \nthe key risk types applicable to FX activities. \nCREDIT/COUNTERPARTY RISK \nPRINCIPLE 27: Market Participants should have adequate processes to manage \ncounterparty credit risk exposure, including where appropriate, through the use of \nappropriate netting and collateral arrangements, such as legally enforceable master \nnetting agreements and credit support arrangements. \nThe use of master netting agreements and credit support arrangements helps to strengthen the \nsmooth functioning of the FX Market. Other measures to manage counterparty credit risk \ninclude the accurate and timely assessment of a counterparty’s creditworthiness prior to a trans- \naction, sufficient diversification of counterparty exposure where appropriate, the prompt \nsetting and monitoring of counterparty exposure limits, and the acceptance of transactions only \nif they fall within approved limits. Credit limits should be set independently of the front office \nand should reflect the established risk appetite of the Market Participant. \nMarket Participants should maintain accurate records material to their counterparty \nrelationships. This could include records of conversations and written correspondence, and \nretention policies should be aligned with Applicable Law. \nFX E-Trading Platforms that have multiple liquidity providers and consumers should at a \nminimum disclose the following as it relates to credit monitoring: \no what mechanisms and/or controls are in place to set, amend, and monitor all \napplicable credit limits; \no whether and how the responsibility of monitoring credit limit breaches falls \nupon the platform or the users, and which parties are responsible for resolving \ncredit limit breaches; and \no what specific methodologies are used to calculate credit exposures (such as Net \nOpen Position, etc). \n MARKET RISK \nPRINCIPLE 28: Market Participants should have processes to measure, monitor, report, \nand manage market risk in an accurate and timely way. \nChanges in FX prices or rates give rise to market risk, which could have an adverse effect on \nthe financial condition of Market Participants. Market risk measurement should be based on \ngenerally accepted measurement techniques and concepts, including the use of stress testing. \nSuch measurement techniques should be periodically and independently reviewed. The \nmeasurement of market risk should take into account hedging and diversification effects."}

When obtaining external data for valuation purposes: \no useful sources of data include screen services, brokers, and other third-party \nproviders; \no a function independent of the front office should check that prices and marked-\nto-market valuations are measured accurately and regularly; \no there should be understanding of what the data represent—for example, if the \nprice was the last actual trade, when the last trade was executed, and if prices \nwere not actual trades how these were calculated. \nMarket Participants should have an internal agreed close of business for each trading day \nagainst which end-of-day positions can be monitored and evaluated. \nWhere reference market prices are not available (for example, in marking-to-market complex \nderivatives or exotic instruments), internal models, validated by an internal function that is \nindependent from the front office, can be used to guide the appropriate pricing of risks. \nOPERATIONAL RISK \nPRINCIPLE 30: Market Participants should have appropriate processes in place to \nidentify and manage operational risks that may arise from human error, inadequate or \nfailed systems or processes, or external events. \nMarket Participants should take into consideration operational risks arising from a global cross-\nborder environment, such as time differences or differences in industry conventions. \nOperational risks could include those arising from human error, misconduct, systems issues, or \nunforeseen external circumstances. \nMarket Participants should put in place strict security measures to address the vulnerability of \ntrading areas and infrastructure to possible operational disruptions, terrorism, or sabotage. \nAccess to the dealing function should be controlled, with procedures in place that specify time \nconstraints, security checks, and management approvals around access, where appropriate, for \nnon-dealing personnel and external visitors."}

Where PVP \nsettlement is not used, Market Participants should reduce the size and duration of their \nSettlement Risk as much as practicable. \nThe management of each area involved in a participant’s FX operations should obtain at least \na high-level understanding of the settlement process and the tools that may be used to mitigate \nSettlement Risk, including, where available, the use of PVP settlement. Market Participants \nshould consider creating internal incentives and mechanisms to reduce risks associated with \nFX settlement. \nIf a counterparty’s chosen method of settlement prevents a Market Participant from reducing \nits Settlement Risk (for example, a counterparty does not participate in PVP arrangements or \ndoes not agree to use obligation netting), then the Market Participant should consider \ndecreasing its exposure limit to the counterparty, creating incentives for the counterparty to \nmodify its FX settlement methods or taking other appropriate risk mitigation actions."}

These principles should be applied in a manner consistent with the \nsize and complexity of the Market Participant’s FX Market activities, and the nature of its \nengagement in the FX market. \nI. \nOverarching Principles \nPRINCIPLE 39: Market Participants should establish consistency between their operating \npractices, their documentation, and their policies for managing credit and legal risk. \nOperating practices (including processes for confirming and settling trades) should be \nconsistent with legal and other documentation. Similarly, the use of mitigants for credit risk \nshould be consistent with this documentation and with the Market Participant’s credit risk \npolicies. \nPRINCIPLE 40: Market Participants should institute a robust framework for monitoring and \nmanaging capacity in both normal and peak conditions. \nAt a minimum, Market Participants should have sufficient technical and operational capability \nto support end-to-end FX processing in both normal and peak market conditions without undue \nimpact on the processing timeline. \nMarket Participants should have defined mechanisms in place to respond to extreme changes \nin demand, as required and on a timely basis. Furthermore, clearly defined and documented \ncapacity and performance management processes should be in place and reviewed regularly, \nincluding with external vendors. \nPRINCIPLE 41: Market Participants are encouraged to implement straight-through \nautomatic transmission of trade data from their front office systems to their operations \nsystems. \nSuch transfer of trade data should be facilitated by means of secure interfaces where the \ntransmitted trade data cannot be changed or deleted during transmission. When trade data \ncannot be transmitted automatically from the front office to the operations system, adequate \ncontrols should be in place so that trade data are captured completely and accurately in the \noperations system. \nPRINCIPLE 42: Market Participants should conduct any novations, amendments, \nand/or cancellations of transactions in a carefully controlled manner."}

Reporting on amendments and cancellations should be made available \nto management in these areas on a regular basis. \n II. \nConfirmation Process \nPRINCIPLE 43: Market Participants should confirm trades as soon as practicable, and \nin a secure and efficient manner. \nMarket Participants should confirm FX trades as soon as practicable after execution, \namendment, or cancellation. The use of automated trade confirmation matching systems, when \navailable, is strongly recommended. Market Participants should also implement operating \npractices that segregate responsibility for trade confirmation from trade execution. \nConfirmations should be transmitted in a secure manner whenever possible, and electronic and \nautomated confirmations are encouraged. When available, standardised message types and \nindustry-agreed templates should be used to confirm FX products. Trades arranged via an IDB \nshould be confirmed directly between both parties to the transaction. Market Participants \nshould receive affirmation from the IDB to assist in accurately booking trades. \nOpen communication methods such as e-mail can significantly increase the risk of fraudulent \ncorrespondence or disclosure of Confidential Information to unauthorised parties. If \nconfirmations are communicated via open communication methods, those methods should \ncomply with information security standard. \nIf Market Participants bilaterally choose to match trades using front-end electronic dealing \nplatforms in place of exchanging traditional confirmation messages, the exchange of trade data \nshould be automated and flow straight-through from the front-end system to operations \nsystems. Strict controls should be in place so that the flow of data between the two systems is \nnot changed and that data is not deleted or manually amended. Any agreements between the \nparties to use electronic dealing platforms for trade matching rather than exchanging traditional \nconfirmation messages should be documented in the legal agreement between the parties. \nPRINCIPLE 44: Market Participants should review, affirm, and allocate block \ntransactions as soon as practicable. \nBlock transaction details should be reviewed and affirmed as soon as practicable follow- ing \nexecution. Investment managers or others acting as Agent on behalf of multiple counterparties \nmay undertake block transactions that are subsequently allocated to specific underlying \ncounterparties. Each underlying counterparty in a block transaction should be an approved and \nexisting counterparty of the dealer-counterparty prior to allocation. Each post-allocation \ntransaction should be advised to the counterparty and confirmed as soon as practicable."}

Market Participants should \nalso carefully reconcile all alleged trades and inform senders of unknown confirmations that \nthe recipient cannot allocate to any internal trade record. \nEscalation procedures should be established to resolve any unconfirmed or disputed terms as a \nmatter of urgency, and processes should be in place to detect and report adverse trends that \nemerge in the discrepancies. \nEscalation procedures should also include notification to trading and other relevant internal \nparties so that they know which counterparties may have practices that do not align with best \npractices regarding confirmation of trades. Senior management should receive regular \ninformation on the number and latency of unconfirmed deals so that they can evaluate the level \nof operational risk being introduced by maintaining dealing relationships with their firms’ \ncounterparties. \nPRINCIPLE 46: Market Participants should be aware of the particular confirmation and \nprocessing features specific to life cycle events of each FX product. \nMarket Participants should establish clear policies and procedures for the confirmation, \nexercise, and settlement of all FX products in which they transact, including those with unique \nfeatures. Where applicable, Market Participants should familiarise personnel re- sponsible for \noperations with the additional terms and conditions associated with various FX products and \nthe protocols and processes around life cycle events to reduce operational risk. Market \nParticipants should also be fully versed in the appropriate terminology, contract provisions, \nand market practices associated with FX products. \nIII. \nNetting and Settlement Processes \nPRINCIPLE 47: Market Participants should properly measure, monitor and control \ntheir Settlement Risk equivalently to other counterparty credit exposures of similar size \nand duration. \nWhere PVP settlement is not used, Settlement Risk should be properly measured, monitored \nand controlled. Market Participants should set binding ex ante limits and use controls \nequivalent to other credit exposures of similar size and duration to the same counterparty. When \na decision is made to allow a client to exceed a limit, appropriate approval should be obtained. \nWhere settlement amounts are to be netted, the initial confirmation of trades to be netted should \nbe performed as it would be for any other FX transaction. All initial trades should be confirmed \nbefore they are included in a netting calculation. In the case of bilateral netting, processes for \nnetting settlement values used by Market Participants should also include a procedure for \nconfirming the bilateral net amounts in each currency at a predetermined cut-off point that has \nbeen agreed upon with the relevant counterparty."}

The responsibility \nfor entering, authenticating, and maintaining SSIs should reside with personnel clearly \nsegregated from a Market Participant’s trading and sales personnel and ideally from those \noperational personnel responsible for trade settlement. SSIs should be securely stored and \nprovided to all relevant settlement systems so as to facilitate straight-through processing. The \nuse of multiple SSIs with the same counterparty for a given product and currency is \ndiscouraged. Because of the Settlement Risks it introduces, the use of multiple SSIs with the \nsame counterparty for a given product and currency should have appropriate controls. \nSSIs should be set up with a defined start date and captured and amended (including audit trail \nrecording) with the appropriate approvals, such as review by at least two individuals. \nCounterparties should be notified of changes to SSIs with sufficient time in advance of their \nimplementation. Changes, notifications, and new SSIs should be delivered via an authenticated, \nand standardised, message type whenever possible. \nAll transactions should be settled in accordance with the SSIs in force on the value date.

These \ninstructions should be exchanged via an authenticated message or other secure means and \nsubsequently verified as part of the trade confirmation process. \nPRINCIPLE 49: Market Participants should request Direct Payments. \nMarket Participants should request Direct Payments when conducting FX transactions and \nrecognise that Third-Party Payments may significantly increase operational risk and potentially \nexpose all parties involved to money laundering or other fraudulent activity. Market \nParticipants engaging in Third-Party Payments should have clearly formulated policies \nregarding their use and any such payments should comply with such policies. \nAt a minimum, these policies should require the payer to be furnished with a clear \nunderstanding of the reasons for Third-Party Payments and for risk assessments to be made in \nrespect of anti-money laundering, counter-terrorism financing, and other Applicable Law. \nArrangements for Third-Party Payments should also be agreed upon and documented between"}

In the event a Third-Party Payment is requested after a trade \nhas been executed, the same level of due diligence should be exercised, and relevant \ncompliance and risk approvals should be sought and secured. \nPRINCIPLE 50: Market Participants should have adequate systems in place to allow \nthem to project, monitor, and manage their intraday and end-of-day funding \nrequirements to reduce potential complications during the settlement process. \nMarket Participants should appropriately manage their funding needs and ensure that they are \nable to meet their FX payment obligations on time. A Market Participant’s failure to meet its \nFX payment obligations in a timely manner may impair the ability of one, or more, \ncounterparties to complete their own settlement, and may lead to liquidity dislocations and \ndisruptions in the payment and settlement systems. \nMarket Participants should have clear procedures outlining how each of their ac- counts used \nfor the settlement of FX transactions is to be funded. Whenever possible, those Market \nParticipants with nostro accounts should be projecting the balance of these accounts on a Real-\nTime basis, including all trades, cancellations, and amendments for each tenor (value date) so \nthat they can diminish the overdraft risk from the nostro account. \nMarket Participants should send payment instructions as soon as practicable, taking into \nconsideration time zone differences as well as instruction receipt cut-off times imposed by their \ncorrespondents. Market Participants should communicate expected receipts (via standardised \nmessage types, when possible) to allow nostro banks to identify and correct payment errors on \na timely basis and aid in the formulation of escalation procedures. \nMarket Participants should communicate with their nostro banks to process the cancellations \nand amendments of payment instructions. Market Participants should understand when they \ncan unilaterally cancel or amend payment instructions and should negotiate with their nostro \nbanks to make these cut-off times as close as possible to the start of the settlement cycle in the \nrelevant currencies. \nIV. \nAccount Reconciliation Processes \nPRINCIPLE 51: Market Participants should perform timely account reconciliation \nprocesses. \nMarket Participants should conduct a regular reconciliation process to reconcile expected cash \nflows against actual cash flows on a timely basis. The sooner reconciliations are performed, \nthe sooner a Market Participant can detect missing or erroneous entries and know its true \naccount balances so that it can take appropriate actions to confirm that its accounts are properly \nfunded. Reconciliations should be carried out by personnel who are not involved in processing \ntransactions that would affect the balances of accounts held with correspondent banks. \nFull reconciliation should occur across nostro accounts as early as possible. To aid in the full \nreconciliation of their nostro accounts, Market Participants should be capable of receiving \nautomated feeds of nostro activity statements and implement automated nostro reconciliation \nsystems.

This has created\nan incentive for banks to hold excess long foreign currency positions, which exposes\nbanks to foreign exchange and other risks. Therefore, to ensure that these risks are\nwell managed and avoid losses that. could pose material systemic challenges, the CBN\nissues the following prudential requirements:\n\n1. Prudential Requirements\na) The Net Open Position (NOP) limit of the overall foreign currency assets and\nliabilities taking into cognizance both those on and off-balance sheet should not\nexceed 20% short or 0% long of shareholders’ funds unimpaired by losses using\nthe Gross Aggregate Method.\n\nb\n\na\n\nBanks whose current NOP exceed 20% short and 0% long of their shareholders’\nfunds unimpaired by losses are required to bring them to prudential limit by\nFebruary 1, 2024.\n\nc) Banks are required to compute their daily and monthly NOP and Foreign\ncurrency trading position (FCTP) using the attached templates.\n\nd) Banks are also required to have adequate stock of high-quality liquid foreign\nassets, i.e. cash and government securities in each significant currency to cover\ntheir maturing foreign currency obligations. In addition, banks should have in\nplace a foreign exchange contingency funding arrangement with other financial\ninstitutions."}
